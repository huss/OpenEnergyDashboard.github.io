	<h1>OED Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</h1>
	<p>A Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is an agreement between an open source project and someone working on that
		project. Here are some key points about the OED CLA:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You agree to give the OED project unlimited and free use of any work you submit. This guarantees that OED
			will remain free and someone cannot later decide to revoke permission which can cause serious issues for the
			project.</li>
		<li>You retain the copyright and are allowed to use your work in any way you wish.</li>
		<li>You are giving us your work "as-is". You are not under any obligation to give support for what you provide.
		</li>
		<li>Your agreeing to the CLA is under the terms of the Mozilla Public License (MPL). The OED project guarantees
			that all its work will remain under the MPL so you are assured that your contributions will always be free
			and open source under the MPL terms.</li>
		<li>The wording of this CLA is consistent and similar to other CLA agreements and not something unique to the
			OED project.</li>
	</ul>

		the project. Thanks! </p>
