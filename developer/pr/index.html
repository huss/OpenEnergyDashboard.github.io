This information is for developers of the OED software so this information is not usually of interest to a general user.







The update to the Redux Toolkit (RTK) is not yet reflected in the documentation. As a result, some information may be out of date.





		While developing your code, we suggest you do the following:
		
			Create a branch of development branch (the main OED branch that is the default when you clone OED) and
				give
				it a name that indicates the work you intend to do. One can do this after the work is complete if not
				done
				earlier. Reusing a branch can cause unexpected updates to a pull request.
			Write test cases for your code. We use Mocha/Chai for testing and a description
					of
					its location and use in OED is available. We need to have all code carefully tested to know it
				is
				working when created but also stays working as future changes are made to OED. Writing good test code
				takes
				real effort but it needs to be done. If not done then that should be stated as a limitation of any pull
				request.
			Make sure you run OED in a web browser and it works as expected. Please check any feature that might
				have
				been impacted by your work and do a quick general check of the system so you know it works.
			Consider if your changes impacted code or documentation that needs updating. For example, did your code
				change OED usage so the documentation pages needed updating? Did you add a script so the Code Organization web page needs update? Did you change database usage
				or a
				function used elsewhere in OED so other code update is needed? It is impossible to give a full list but
				checking this out helps the project. In some cases you can note the needed changes in your pull request
				to
				make sure they get done outside your work.
			Run our checks. Lint is a system that verifies that your code does not have certain syntax or running
				issues
				along with making sure it follows our expectations for code style. It also verifies that each file has
				the
				needed license at the top and that TypeScript is used where expected. You will likely find it easier if
				you
				run this check early to find any issues so you don&#39;t repeat them many times (those working in VSC should
				see
				some being tested as your are coding). The checks are run in a terminal in the web/vsc Docker
				container:
				npm run check
			
			Run our code tests. These run all the test cases to verify the code is running correctly. It is similar
				to
				running lint where you use: npm run test This can take several minutes. A summary
				will
				be given at the bottom. If you see any errors then they should be checked out. Let us know if you need
				help.
				You will do the same command to check any new tests you add. See other
					info for faster running of single tests for debugging. Also note that the tests deliberately try
				to
				do invalid operations to test OED. This causes warning/errors in the OED output as well as in the
				PostgreSQL
				log that will be shown in the next install. 
			Make sure you keep your fork up to date with development on the main OED GitHub. Other people may
				integrate
				new code into OED and your work needs to be in sync with that work.
		
		When your fork has code that is ready to add to the OED code base, create a pull request from your branch
			into
			development on the main OED GitHub repository (GitHub documentation). The pull request template should include the
			following:
		
			An area at the top to describe this PR. It states: &quot;Please include a summary of the change and which
				issue
				is touched on. Please also include relevant motivation and context.&quot; This is also the area to add
				recognition of others that worked on code. Use the @&amp;lt;GitHub name&amp;gt; where you put in the person&#39;s
				actual
				GitHub name (user id) without the angle brackets and GitHub will automatically link to their GitHub
				account.
			
			Note any issues this pull request addresses. Check to see if you are addressing any open issues. If so,
				please note in the pull request description. If your pull request completely fixes/addresses an open
				issue
				then put the words &quot;Fixes #XXX&quot;, where XXX is the issue number. If it only partly addresses an issue
				then
				use &quot;Partly Addresses #XXX&quot;. If it fixes an open issue then everyone will see a note in the pull request
				(after opened) indicating it will close this issue when merged and there is also a related note in the
				issue.
			There is a checkbox to indicate: &quot;Note merging this changes the database configuration.&quot; This indicates
				that
				the database needs to be updated for these changes to work correctly. Normally there will be migration
				files
				to update the database. However, many developers will choose to reinitialize the database to do a clean
				install to be sure everything works correctly.
			There is a checkbox to indicate: &quot;This change requires a documentation update&quot;. This indicates that some
				documentation (documentation pages, developer or website) needs modification based on the changes in the
				pull
				request.
			There is a checkbox to indicate: &quot;I have followed the [OED pull
				request](../pr/) ideas&quot;
			There is a checkbox to indicate: &quot;I have removed text in ( ) from the issue request&quot;. The template puts
				directions in ( ) and they should be removed once done to save space and make the pull request cleaner.
			
			There is a checkbox to indicate: &quot;You acknowledge that every person contributing to this work has signed
				the
				OED Contributing License Agreement and each author is listed in the Description section.&quot;
			An area to list any limitations of the PR: &quot;Describe any issues that remain or work that should still be
				done.&quot;
			If your work is not yet ready and you are sharing to get early feedback, please mark the pull request as
				a
				draft.
		
		When your pull request is submitted, automated GitHub Actions will run including static code checks and the
			OED
			test code that will do the checks and tests. If they pass then a green check mark will be put next to them
			and
			your pull request can be considered. If they fail, you should see why and fix the issue on your branch. When
			you
			push the change to your GitHub account (with the fork of OED), your pull request will automatically be
			updated
			and recheck. Note that the tests will not automatically run if this is your first pull request to OED. In
			that
			case it will wait until the project authorizes it to run.
		You can tell if there were any issues with the automated GitHub Actions by looking at the commit on the pull
			request. Toward the right side of the line with the commit there will either be a green check mark
			(everything
			is okay) or a red x (indicating issues). (It could be yellow of the checks have not finished which normally
			takes 1-4 minutes.) If you click on either, a popup has a link to the &quot;details&quot;. Normally the issue is with
			the
			OED tests (and not from the automated testing setup). To see these, open up the section labeled &quot;node
			tests&quot;.
			This will show all the checks (lint, typescript, etc.) and the automated unit tests. Normally there will be
			an
			error message (either at the end or in several places). This should indicate where the error occurred and
			help
			in tracking it down. Note that an error can cause the testing to stop so it is possible there are more
			errors
			that will show up once the earlier one is fixed. See above about running the tests on your machine and the
			developer details page has information on running a limited number of tests.
		Once your pull request is passing all automated checks, it needs to be reviewed by at least one OED team
			member
			with that privilege. The review might make suggestions and may request changes. Once that process is
			complete, a
			senior member of the team will either approve the pull request or make other comments (if not already
			reviewed
			by a senior member). Once approved, the pull request can be merged into development for inclusion into the
			OED
			code base.
		As always, if you have questions about this process or run into issues, you can contact the development team
			using the link at the bottom of this page.">

This information is for developers of the OED software so this information is not usually of interest to a general user.







The update to the Redux Toolkit (RTK) is not yet reflected in the documentation. As a result, some information may be out of date.





		While developing your code, we suggest you do the following:
		
			Create a branch of development branch (the main OED branch that is the default when you clone OED) and
				give
				it a name that indicates the work you intend to do. One can do this after the work is complete if not
				done
				earlier. Reusing a branch can cause unexpected updates to a pull request.
			Write test cases for your code. We use Mocha/Chai for testing and a description
					of
					its location and use in OED is available. We need to have all code carefully tested to know it
				is
				working when created but also stays working as future changes are made to OED. Writing good test code
				takes
				real effort but it needs to be done. If not done then that should be stated as a limitation of any pull
				request.
			Make sure you run OED in a web browser and it works as expected. Please check any feature that might
				have
				been impacted by your work and do a quick general check of the system so you know it works.
			Consider if your changes impacted code or documentation that needs updating. For example, did your code
				change OED usage so the documentation pages needed updating? Did you add a script so the Code Organization web page needs update? Did you change database usage
				or a
				function used elsewhere in OED so other code update is needed? It is impossible to give a full list but
				checking this out helps the project. In some cases you can note the needed changes in your pull request
				to
				make sure they get done outside your work.
			Run our checks. Lint is a system that verifies that your code does not have certain syntax or running
				issues
				along with making sure it follows our expectations for code style. It also verifies that each file has
				the
				needed license at the top and that TypeScript is used where expected. You will likely find it easier if
				you
				run this check early to find any issues so you don&#39;t repeat them many times (those working in VSC should
				see
				some being tested as your are coding). The checks are run in a terminal in the web/vsc Docker
				container:
				npm run check
			
			Run our code tests. These run all the test cases to verify the code is running correctly. It is similar
				to
				running lint where you use: npm run test This can take several minutes. A summary
				will
				be given at the bottom. If you see any errors then they should be checked out. Let us know if you need
				help.
				You will do the same command to check any new tests you add. See other
					info for faster running of single tests for debugging. Also note that the tests deliberately try
				to
				do invalid operations to test OED. This causes warning/errors in the OED output as well as in the
				PostgreSQL
				log that will be shown in the next install. 
			Make sure you keep your fork up to date with development on the main OED GitHub. Other people may
				integrate
				new code into OED and your work needs to be in sync with that work.
		
		When your fork has code that is ready to add to the OED code base, create a pull request from your branch
			into
			development on the main OED GitHub repository (GitHub documentation). The pull request template should include the
			following:
		
			An area at the top to describe this PR. It states: &quot;Please include a summary of the change and which
				issue
				is touched on. Please also include relevant motivation and context.&quot; This is also the area to add
				recognition of others that worked on code. Use the @&amp;lt;GitHub name&amp;gt; where you put in the person&#39;s
				actual
				GitHub name (user id) without the angle brackets and GitHub will automatically link to their GitHub
				account.
			
			Note any issues this pull request addresses. Check to see if you are addressing any open issues. If so,
				please note in the pull request description. If your pull request completely fixes/addresses an open
				issue
				then put the words &quot;Fixes #XXX&quot;, where XXX is the issue number. If it only partly addresses an issue
				then
				use &quot;Partly Addresses #XXX&quot;. If it fixes an open issue then everyone will see a note in the pull request
				(after opened) indicating it will close this issue when merged and there is also a related note in the
				issue.
			There is a checkbox to indicate: &quot;Note merging this changes the database configuration.&quot; This indicates
				that
				the database needs to be updated for these changes to work correctly. Normally there will be migration
				files
				to update the database. However, many developers will choose to reinitialize the database to do a clean
				install to be sure everything works correctly.
			There is a checkbox to indicate: &quot;This change requires a documentation update&quot;. This indicates that some
				documentation (documentation pages, developer or website) needs modification based on the changes in the
				pull
				request.
			There is a checkbox to indicate: &quot;I have followed the [OED pull
				request](../pr/) ideas&quot;
			There is a checkbox to indicate: &quot;I have removed text in ( ) from the issue request&quot;. The template puts
				directions in ( ) and they should be removed once done to save space and make the pull request cleaner.
			
			There is a checkbox to indicate: &quot;You acknowledge that every person contributing to this work has signed
				the
				OED Contributing License Agreement and each author is listed in the Description section.&quot;
			An area to list any limitations of the PR: &quot;Describe any issues that remain or work that should still be
				done.&quot;
			If your work is not yet ready and you are sharing to get early feedback, please mark the pull request as
				a
				draft.
		
		When your pull request is submitted, automated GitHub Actions will run including static code checks and the
			OED
			test code that will do the checks and tests. If they pass then a green check mark will be put next to them
			and
			your pull request can be considered. If they fail, you should see why and fix the issue on your branch. When
			you
			push the change to your GitHub account (with the fork of OED), your pull request will automatically be
			updated
			and recheck. Note that the tests will not automatically run if this is your first pull request to OED. In
			that
			case it will wait until the project authorizes it to run.
		You can tell if there were any issues with the automated GitHub Actions by looking at the commit on the pull
			request. Toward the right side of the line with the commit there will either be a green check mark
			(everything
			is okay) or a red x (indicating issues). (It could be yellow of the checks have not finished which normally
			takes 1-4 minutes.) If you click on either, a popup has a link to the &quot;details&quot;. Normally the issue is with
			the
			OED tests (and not from the automated testing setup). To see these, open up the section labeled &quot;node
			tests&quot;.
			This will show all the checks (lint, typescript, etc.) and the automated unit tests. Normally there will be
			an
			error message (either at the end or in several places). This should indicate where the error occurred and
			help
			in tracking it down. Note that an error can cause the testing to stop so it is possible there are more
			errors
			that will show up once the earlier one is fixed. See above about running the tests on your machine and the
			developer details page has information on running a limited number of tests.
		Once your pull request is passing all automated checks, it needs to be reviewed by at least one OED team
			member
			with that privilege. The review might make suggestions and may request changes. Once that process is
			complete, a
			senior member of the team will either approve the pull request or make other comments (if not already
			reviewed
			by a senior member). Once approved, the pull request can be merged into development for inclusion into the
			OED
			code base.
		As always, if you have questions about this process or run into issues, you can contact the development team
			using the link at the bottom of this page.">

<div class="alert-box info "><p>This information is for developers of the OED software so this information is not usually of interest to a general user.</p>
</div>






<div class="alert-box warning "><p>The update to the Redux Toolkit (RTK) is not yet reflected in the documentation. As a result, some information may be out of date.</p>
</div>




		<p>While developing your code, we suggest you do the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a branch of development branch (the main OED branch that is the default when you clone OED) and
				give
				it a name that indicates the work you intend to do. One can do this after the work is complete if not
				done
				earlier. Reusing a branch can cause unexpected updates to a pull request.</li>
			<li>Write test cases for your code. We use Mocha/Chai for testing and a <a href="../testing/">description
					of
					its location and use in OED</a> is available. We need to have all code carefully tested to know it
				is
				working when created but also stays working as future changes are made to OED. Writing good test code
				takes
				real effort but it needs to be done. If not done then that should be stated as a limitation of any pull
				request.</li>
			<li>Make sure you run OED in a web browser and it works as expected. Please check any feature that might
				have
				been impacted by your work and do a quick general check of the system so you know it works.</li>
			<li>Consider if your changes impacted code or documentation that needs updating. For example, did your code
				change OED usage so the documentation pages needed updating? Did you add a script so the <a
					href="../codeOrganization/">Code Organization</a> web page needs update? Did you change database usage
				or a
				function used elsewhere in OED so other code update is needed? It is impossible to give a full list but
				checking this out helps the project. In some cases you can note the needed changes in your pull request
				to
				make sure they get done outside your work.</li>
			<li>Run our checks. Lint is a system that verifies that your code does not have certain syntax or running
				issues
				along with making sure it follows our expectations for code style. It also verifies that each file has
				the
				needed license at the top and that TypeScript is used where expected. You will likely find it easier if
				you
				run this check early to find any issues so you don't repeat them many times (those working in VSC should
				see
				some being tested as your are coding). The checks are run in a terminal in the web/vsc Docker
				container:<br>
				<code>npm run check</code><br>
			</li>
			<li>Run our code tests. These run all the test cases to verify the code is running correctly. It is similar
				to
				running lint where you use: <br><code>npm run test</code><br> This can take several minutes. A summary
				will
				be given at the bottom. If you see any errors then they should be checked out. Let us know if you need
				help.
				You will do the same command to check any new tests you add. See <a
					href="../devDetails/#singleTest">other
					info</a> for faster running of single tests for debugging. Also note that the tests deliberately try
				to
				do invalid operations to test OED. This causes warning/errors in the OED output as well as in the
				PostgreSQL
				log that will be shown in the next install. </li>
			<li>Make sure you keep your fork up to date with development on the main OED GitHub. Other people may
				integrate
				new code into OED and your work needs to be in sync with that work.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When your fork has code that is ready to add to the OED code base, create a pull request from your branch
			into
			development on the main OED GitHub repository (<a
				href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork"
				rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub documentation</a>). The pull request template should include the
			following:
		<ul>
			<li>An area at the top to describe this PR. It states: "Please include a summary of the change and which
				issue
				is touched on. Please also include relevant motivation and context." This is also the area to add
				recognition of others that worked on code. Use the @&lt;GitHub name&gt; where you put in the person's
				actual
				GitHub name (user id) without the angle brackets and GitHub will automatically link to their GitHub
				account.
			</li>
			<li>Note any issues this pull request addresses. Check to see if you are addressing any open issues. If so,
				please note in the pull request description. If your pull request completely fixes/addresses an open
				issue
				then put the words "Fixes #XXX", where XXX is the issue number. If it only partly addresses an issue
				then
				use "Partly Addresses #XXX". If it fixes an open issue then everyone will see a note in the pull request
				(after opened) indicating it will close this issue when merged and there is also a related note in the
				issue.</li>
			<li>There is a checkbox to indicate: "Note merging this changes the database configuration." This indicates
				that
				the database needs to be updated for these changes to work correctly. Normally there will be migration
				files
				to update the database. However, many developers will choose to reinitialize the database to do a clean
				install to be sure everything works correctly.</li>
			<li>There is a checkbox to indicate: "This change requires a documentation update". This indicates that some
				documentation (documentation pages, developer or website) needs modification based on the changes in the
				pull
				request.</li>
			<li>There is a checkbox to indicate: "I have followed the [OED pull
				request](../pr/) ideas"</li>
			<li>There is a checkbox to indicate: "I have removed text in ( ) from the issue request". The template puts
				directions in ( ) and they should be removed once done to save space and make the pull request cleaner.
			</li>
			<li>There is a checkbox to indicate: "You acknowledge that every person contributing to this work has signed
				the
				OED Contributing License Agreement and each author is listed in the Description section."</li>
			<li>An area to list any limitations of the PR: "Describe any issues that remain or work that should still be
				done."</li>
			<li>If your work is not yet ready and you are sharing to get early feedback, please mark the pull request as
				a
				draft.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When your pull request is submitted, automated GitHub Actions will run including static code checks and the
			OED
			test code that will do the checks and tests. If they pass then a green check mark will be put next to them
			and
			your pull request can be considered. If they fail, you should see why and fix the issue on your branch. When
			you
			push the change to your GitHub account (with the fork of OED), your pull request will automatically be
			updated
			and recheck. Note that the tests will not automatically run if this is your first pull request to OED. In
			that
			case it will wait until the project authorizes it to run.</p>
		<p>You can tell if there were any issues with the automated GitHub Actions by looking at the commit on the pull
			request. Toward the right side of the line with the commit there will either be a green check mark
			(everything
			is okay) or a red x (indicating issues). (It could be yellow of the checks have not finished which normally
			takes 1-4 minutes.) If you click on either, a popup has a link to the "details". Normally the issue is with
			the
			OED tests (and not from the automated testing setup). To see these, open up the section labeled "node
			tests".
			This will show all the checks (lint, typescript, etc.) and the automated unit tests. Normally there will be
			an
			error message (either at the end or in several places). This should indicate where the error occurred and
			help
			in tracking it down. Note that an error can cause the testing to stop so it is possible there are more
			errors
			that will show up once the earlier one is fixed. See above about running the tests on your machine and the
			developer details page has information on running a limited number of tests.</p>
		<p>Once your pull request is passing all automated checks, it needs to be reviewed by at least one OED team
			member
			with that privilege. The review might make suggestions and may request changes. Once that process is
			complete, a
			senior member of the team will either approve the pull request or make other comments (if not already
			reviewed
			by a senior member). Once approved, the pull request can be merged into development for inclusion into the
			OED
			code base.</p>
		<p>As always, if you have questions about this process or run into issues, you can contact the development team
			using the link at the bottom of this page.</p>
