	<!-- Add version info at top of page. Would be nice if could put in layout but then relative link does not work. -->
	<p>The info on this page is for OED version 0.8.0. See "Help versions" menu at top of page for other versions.</p>
	<!-- Page content -->
	<h1>Main Admin Page (Help)</h1>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>The main admin page allows admins to change site preferences and control users.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>You must be <a href="admin.html#usage">logged in</a> as an admin to access these features.</p>

	<p>On the main OED page, click the "Admin Panel" button in
		the top,
		right (highlighted with a blue box) to go to the main admin page as shown in the next figure.</p>
	<img alt="main OED page for admin" src="./images/OEDMainPageForAdmin.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>You will now be on the main admin page as shown in the next figure. Each area of the page is described below.
		It is important that you click the "Submit" button at the bottom of the page to save your changes to the
			database so users will see your changes.</p>
	</p>
	<img alt="admin page" src="./images/OEDAdminPage.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">

	<h3>Manage: Users</h3>
	<p>This allows admins to manage the users on the system. Help on this feature is on the <a
			href="adminUser.html">admin user</a> help page.</p>

	<h3>Default Site Title</h3>
	<p>Clicking the box below this label will allow you to enter or edit the OED site title shown at the top of each
		page. You should try to keep the title fairly short so that it does not take up too much space on each page. The
		title will remain blank until you enter one.</p>

	<h3>Default Graph Type</h3>
	<p>When a user first loads OED, you can control the <a href="graphType.html">graph type</a> that will appear. The
		user can still change to another graph type if they wish. The types of graphs you can choose mirror the ones
		allowed. Simply click the circle next to your choice. The default will be "Line" unless you change it.</p>

	<h3>Default Bar Stacking</h3>
	<p>The <a href="barGraphic.html#barStacking">bar stacking</a> option allows the bar graphic to show as single,
		stacked bar for each time frame. By default this is off. You can make it default to on by clicking the box next
		to "Bar Stacking". If checked, you can click to remove this choice.</p>

	<h3>Default Language</h3>
	<p>Clicking one of the languages below this label will set OED to use that language for its strings within the
		application for all users. The default language is "English" until you change it. Users can manually change the
		language if desired.</p>

	<h3>Default Time Zone</h3>
	<p>OED works with <a href="time.html">time</a> in a time zone neutral way. However, when data is exported
		from OED, the person may want to have information on the time zone of that data. The dropdown menu contains
		every possible standard time zone in the world. You can type at the top to search the list. The selected time
		zone becomes the default value if none is set for the <a href="adminMeterViewing.html">meter</a>. Note this has
		no impact on what is shown within OED and is strictly for export of data. The site value for time zone is
		overridden if a value is set for a specific meter.</p>

	<h3>Default Warning File Size</h3>
	<p>The <a href="export.html">exporting data</a> page discusses file size limits for raw exports. This value controls
		the size of what is considered a small file.</p>

	<h3>Default File Size Limit</h3>
	<p>The <a href="export.html">exporting data</a> page discusses file size limits for raw exports. This value controls
		the size of what is considered a large file which is also the same as the upper limit for a medium size file.</p>

	<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
	<p>The map graphic cannot be made the default graphic type at this time. We expect that will change soon.</p>
	<p>The popup help is set to be language settable but the translations are not yet done. The help pages on the web
		(linked from within the app help) are not translated but may be in the future.</p>
	<p>Once you set a time zone, you cannot unset the value to nothing. This is not commonly done but we plan to fix
		this in a
		future release.</p>
	<p>The feature to include time zone information with exported data is not yet available. The ability to set time
		zones is included now so sites can begin setting any necessary value.</p>
	<p>It is not difficult to include additional languages within OED. If you are willing to translate the strings, we
		can provide a file to type them in that can then be permanently stored with our source code so your site and
		other sites will always have that language. We will also modify OED to show that language choice on the admin
		page. We welcome the addition of languages to OED. If interested then please contact us.</p>
