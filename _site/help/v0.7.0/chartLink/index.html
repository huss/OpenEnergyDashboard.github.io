	<h1>Chart Link (Help)</h1>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>There are times when you want to be able to reproduce the look of an OED graphic. For example, you want to
		provide or post a link so others can easily see a given graphic to make a point such as a comparison graph
		during an energy competition. Another example is where you create a complex graphic and want to be able to come
		back to it later to do more work. Whatever your reason, the chart link feature was designed to meet this need.
		It will provide a URL (web page link or can be used in the web browser address bar) that, when used, will
		recreate the graphic you currently see. While the same
		graphic is reproduced, you are in a full featured version of OED so you can continue to interact with the
		system as you wish.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>First create the graphic that you want to reproduce. It can contain any graphic type, meters/groups, date range,
		etc. that you are interested in showing. Then click the "Toggle chart link" button (highlighted in a blue box in
		the next figure) to reveal the URL for this graphic. This URL may be long if you have lots of items and choices
		you made. You do not need to worry about the characters in the URL since it will just work. Once the URL is
		revealed, use your mouse to select the entire URL string (everything in the box revealed). (Note that using
		select all will highlight everything on the page and not just the URL so that will not work.) The following
		figure shows the image after doing all of this where the URL string was highlighted in blue by the web browser
		when selected.</p>
	<img alt="getting the chart link URL" src="./images/OEDChartLink.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
	<p>The sample graphic above has a reduced time range for the line graphic to show that all the features of the
		graphic will be reproduced. There is a checkbox labeled "Hide menu from link" (highlighted with a blue box in
		next figure). If it is checked, the URL will
		change so when it is used the menus on the left side will dock at the top, right of the screen. (See <a
			href="hideOptions.html">hiding options</a> page for a complete description). Using the modified URL will
		automatically hide all these options when used. This can be useful if you want to use the URL to display
		information on a monitor without interaction or to discourage changing the image. Note that when the URL is
		used, a full featured OED is active so you can still use the docked menus as described on the hiding menu
		options page. The result of clicking on this box is shown in the next figure where you can see the URL changed
		from the previous figure.</p>

		style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">

	<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
	<p>Because the slider for changing the time on the line graphic is controlled by Plotly code (our graphics package),
		OED does not immediately see that change. As a result, if you change the time range while the chart link area is
		open, you must click the "Toggle
		chart link" button to close it up and then click it again to reopen it. OED will then have updated the URL for
		the new time range.</p>
	<p>You should not change (edit) the chart link to try to get other features. It is always best to create the graphic
		and use the URL provided by OED. The chart link will not work across OED sites as it contains the web address
		and specific meters/groups of
		your site.</p>
	<p>The URL shown is from a development system and not a regular site. Thus, the URL is special and will not work on
		a normal site. As indicated above, you should use the URL given by OED on your site.</p>
