	<h1>Admin Data Acquisition (Help)</h1>
	<p>Note: These features are only available to select people who oversee the OED site (called admins) so these
    features are not usually of interest to a general user. </p>


	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>The OED system stores and works with readings. These are normally thought of as meter readings but can come from
		any source. OED has a standard way to acquire these readings but also provides software that can take readings
		from other sources and manipulate them to fit our model of how readings should come to OED. This allows for
		sites to directly acquire readings from a number of sources. At the current time OED has systems in place to
		automatically acquire data from CSV files, eGauge meters, Obvius AcquiSuite and MAMAC meters. These are
		described below. Note
		that it is possible to do this for other meter
		systems. We are willing to either work with you (or another party) to create the needed code or, if it
		seems appropriate, create this code for a new type of device. Please <a href="../../contact.html">contact us</a>
		if that is of interest.</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<h3>CSV</h3>
	<p>The standard way OED acquires information about meters and readings is via information in CSV files. Data passed
		in this way goes through the standard data acquisition pipeline where it is checked for a number of possible
		errors/issues before being added into the OED system. The other acquisition types supported in the following
		sections are filters that process the data supplied in these vendor's format
		and convert it into the canonical CSV format that OED expects for standard processing. The details for uploading
		a CSV file into OED are described
		on the <a href="adminCsvImport.html">admin CSV Import page</a>.</p>

	<h3>eGauge</h3>
	<p><a href="https://www.egauge.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer">eGauge meters</a> are hardware devices that collect
		electricity usage. OED can acquire eGauge meter data as described <a href="adminEgauge.html">here</a>.</p>

	<h3>Obvius</h3>
	<p><a href="http://www.obvius.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obvius
			AcquiSuite</a> acquires meter data using Obvius hardware for a large number of metering devices. The system
		has the ability to provide this data to other systems. OED uses the push mechanism where AcquiSuite periodically
		sends OED this data. As we work with more sites in using Obvius, we plan to provide instructions to let you do
		this yourself. For now, please contact us and we will help you through this process.</p>

	<h3>MAMAC meters</h3>
	<p><a href="http://mamacsys.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MAMAC meters</a> are hardware devices that collect
		various types of metering data. OED can acquire MAMAC meter data as described <a
			href="adminMamac.html">here</a>.</p>
