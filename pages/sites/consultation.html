<p>Choosing an energy/resource dashboard can raise many questions and is a significant undertaking. OED wants to help
  and understands that each site is unique. We also want you to make an informed decision that will meet your needs. We
  are here for you and the community and not to make money or sell our dashboard. With this in mind, OED offers a
  consultation to hear your thoughts and questions and hopefully provide appropriate information. Here are some details:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are a nonprofit organization then the consultation is free. If not, we can discuss an appropriate fee. We
    try to keep the cost low and any money collected is used to fund the development of the project (and not pay
    money to the person you consult with).</li>
  <li>We strive to provide timely consultations with every organization that asks. As long as the total number of
    requests does not exceed our capacity as a volunteer driven project, OED will continue to do this. In any case, you
    can expect a timely response from the project.</li>
  <li>The consultation will normally be with a senior member of the project who can discuss (almost) any aspect of the
    OED project and have experience with site needs.</li>
  <li>The initial consultation is around 30 minutes. We can do additional ones if appropriate.</li>
  <li><a href="/contact">Contacting</a> the OED project is not considered a consultation. Even after the initial
    consultation, OED remains available to help you with everything from dashboard setup, issues you encounter or other
    inquiries.</li>
</ul>
