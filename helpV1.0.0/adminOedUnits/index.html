These features are only available to select people who oversee the OED site (called admins) so this information is not usually of interest to a general user.





        The following assumes as you have an understanding of general units.
        OED supplied units
        While a site can create any desired unit and conversion, OED wants to make setup as easy as possible. To
            facilitate this, OED provides certain units and conversions as part of its installation. The following units
            and
            conversions are provided by OED.

        Without action by the site admin, the only graphing unit visible to a user is kWh. A meter unit
            Electric_Utility
            is usable kWh meters because those are never directly displayable to the user. The other units can be made
            available as a graphing unit if the displayable is changed to all.

        Most of these conversions will not be visible to the user until the units involved are made visible to the
            user.
            The
            conversion of Electric_Utility to kWh is relating the Electric_Utility meter unit to kWh in which it reads
            so
            the
            slope
            is 1 as no conversion is effectively applied. The values for slope and intercept should be fairly standard
            ones
            that
            all sites are comfortable using but can be edited if desired. Note that chained conversions means that all
            the
            energy
            units (kWh, BTU, m³ gas) can be used and converted between.">

These features are only available to select people who oversee the OED site (called admins) so this information is not usually of interest to a general user.





        The following assumes as you have an understanding of general units.
        OED supplied units
        While a site can create any desired unit and conversion, OED wants to make setup as easy as possible. To
            facilitate this, OED provides certain units and conversions as part of its installation. The following units
            and
            conversions are provided by OED.

        Without action by the site admin, the only graphing unit visible to a user is kWh. A meter unit
            Electric_Utility
            is usable kWh meters because those are never directly displayable to the user. The other units can be made
            available as a graphing unit if the displayable is changed to all.

        Most of these conversions will not be visible to the user until the units involved are made visible to the
            user.
            The
            conversion of Electric_Utility to kWh is relating the Electric_Utility meter unit to kWh in which it reads
            so
            the
            slope
            is 1 as no conversion is effectively applied. The values for slope and intercept should be fairly standard
            ones
            that
            all sites are comfortable using but can be edited if desired. Note that chained conversions means that all
            the
            energy
            units (kWh, BTU, m³ gas) can be used and converted between.">

        <p>Most of these conversions will not be visible to the user until the units involved are made visible to the
            user.
            The
            conversion of Electric_Utility to kWh is relating the Electric_Utility meter unit to kWh in which it reads
            so
            the
            slope
            is 1 as no conversion is effectively applied. The values for slope and intercept should be fairly standard
            ones
            that
            all sites are comfortable using but can be edited if desired. Note that chained conversions means that all
            the
            energy
            units (kWh, BTU, m³ gas) can be used and converted between.</p>
