		Overview
		A line graphic shows each meter and group as a unique line showing usage across time. The following figure
			shows
			a line graphic of two meters (Meter 1 and Meter 2) and one group (Group 1 &amp; 2) where the group contains the
			two
			meters (the one sample time point from the hover values of Group 1 &amp; 2 is seen to be the sum of the two
			meters).
			Each line represents power usage at that time for the indicated meter/group, e.g., kW for electricity. To
			get
			this graphic, you
			click the
			&quot;Line&quot;
			choice
			(highlighted with a blue box).
		
		A line graphic can show an arbitrary choice and number of meters and groups. As described below, you can
			control
			the time frame (dates shown) on the line graphic.

		Usage
		You select the meters and/or groups to
			graph
			in the usual way. OED will display each meter and group as an individual line as shown in the figure above.
			For
			this section the graphics use synthetic data since values are easier to see. In this data, the meters have a
			constant value for long periods of time. Also, we will often use meters in these sample figures
			but the same ideas apply equally to groups.
			The time frame (days) shown on the x-axis will be the maximum time for all all meters and groups. If
			different
			meters and group have data for different time ranges then some lines will not span the entire length of the
			x-axis. The next figure shows this where the Meter C and Meter D do not span the full range of time on the
			graph
			so the beginning and end of the graphic does not have values for these two meters.
		
		
		This graphic also demonstrates another potential issue. If the values of one or more meters (or groups) are
			substantially
			less than another meter (or group) then the values for these meters will be very close to the x-axis. You
			can
			see these
			values by removing the values for the meters or groups with larger values. One way to do this is to remove a
			meter from graphing by clicking the &quot;X&quot; next to its name in the list (details on the meters/groups viewing help
			pages). This works but is slower since OED must recalculate the values via the server (see details below). It also means you won&#39;t see these meters/groups in other graphics
			since
			they were removed. A nice solution is to click on the name of the meter/group at the top of the line
			graphic. In
			the next figure, Meter D was clicked (highlighted with blue box) and the graph quickly redrew to
			what is shown with the y-axis scale re-calibrated for the remaining meters. The meter not being shown is in
			shadow font. You can click to remove as many lines as desired.
		
		You can click on a meter/group in shadow font to get it to quickly reappear on the line graphic. Note that
			going
			to another graphic will reset the
			lines shown so any hidden meters will show again.

		Scrolling and zooming
		Initially, OED shows the line graphic across all time that is available. Sometimes you want to look at a
			smaller
			time range. You can achieve this by zooming in the time (x) axis. This is done by clicking and dragging the
			rectangles with black border below the x-axis (highlighted with blue boxes in the figure below). As you
			slide
			the
			black rectangle, the parts of the x-axis (time) that is removed from the graph is show by a gray filled
			rectangle (highlighted in light blue boxes but goes also goes to center of rectangle but not highlighted
			since
			then hard to see other blue box). The white area between the gray rectangles is the time being shown.
			In
			the figure below the original time from of January through December was reduced to March through August.
		
		Note that the time range selected on a line graphic is also used for the Bar Graphic.
		Once you are zoomed in so gray areas are shown for the removed time, you can click within these areas to
			modify
			the time range shown but the behavior is a little more complex and likely to take time to learn to use.
		If only part of the time is shown, then you can scroll to see the other times. The total time displayed
			remains
			the same but the times included change as you scroll. You do this by clicking and dragging in the white area
			below the x-axis
			that shows the time being displayed (highlighted with blue box in the next figure). The next figure shows
			the
			process
			of dragging where the time displayed has now changed to May through October.
		

		If you zoom in significantly so the time range is much smaller than the original time range, the graph can
			become
			jagged due to having too few points. Also, you might want to return the graphic to its original, full time
			range. Both of these are discussed in the next section on the &quot;Redraw&quot; and &quot;Restore&quot; buttons.
		

		Redraw and Restore buttons
		The next figure shows the result of zooming in even farther so a limited time range of one month is shown. It
			also only shows one meter so the effects are easier to see.
		
		As you can see, the line has become vague because the time points are far apart. This happens due to the
			limited
			number of points available. (see below for the details of why). If you want to
			see
			this time range with more
			points then click the &quot;Redraw&quot; button (highlighted with a blue box) below the graph. The figure below shows
			the
			result of
			doing this where you can see that many more points are present. In this case it is using the original meter
			data
			which is spaced one hour apart.
		
		Note that once you do this, the time range is reset so you cannot zoom outward nor scroll to times outside
			the
			new range but you can zoom in farther so you can do this. If you want to see other time ranges, you can
			click
			the &quot;Restore&quot; button (highlighted with a blue
			box) and the graph will return to its original view with the time range including all meters. The result of
			doing this is shown in the next figure. Notice that it matches the Meter 2 line in the original figure at
			the
			top of this page.
		

		Details

		Exporting graph data
		You can export the data represented on a line graphic. You can use the line graph to get the time range and
			meters/groups you want. See the export help page for further information.

		Plotly graph controls
		As shown in the next figure, the Plotly (the underlying graphic package) graphical
			controls (highlighted by a blue box) are available for usage. The most useful might be the camera that
			allows
			you to download a PNG for the graph. If you hover over a Plotly control icon it will show its name. Note
			that
			using some of the other controls (zoom, pan, etc.) may cause
			unexpected behavior as OED is also using those features.
		

		Colors of lines
		The color of lines is always the same for a given meter or group. This means everyone sees the same color
			for a
			given meter or group whenever it is graphed. The line colors are chosen to try to provide contrast
			between
			different lines. They are also designed to
			give some differentiation between meters and groups when possible. OED tries to show meters in lighter
			colors
			and
			groups in darker colors. This is not guaranteed as colors are reused between groups and meters if the number
			in
			either category becomes large. OED also tries to give a unique color to each line but that may not
			happen when
			the number of meters and groups is large. Note both of these depend on the number of meters and groups
			at the
			OED site and not the number being shown. Finally, a given meter or group will have the same color on the
			line,
			bar and map graphic.

		Why do I need to Redraw and Restore?
		OED is designed to be fast on any reasonable device. When you are zooming and scrolling within a line
			graphic,
			the work is all done in your web browser so it will have a very fast response rate. If OED recalculated
			the
			points shown as you zoomed/scrolled then it would be substantially slower, esp. if it needed to access
			the
			site&#39;s server to get new
			data. OED could try to determine when you are done zooming/scrolling and then recalculate the points but
			it is
			very difficult to determine when that has happened given users often pause during these operations.
			Thus, to be
			fast and allow you to get high quality line graphs, OED needs you to let it know when you are done and
			need the
			points displayed to be reset. The &quot;Redraw&quot; button is how you do that. You can also tell OED when you want
			to go
			back to the original graphic via the &quot;Restore&quot; button. This allows you to see all the data and/or
			zoom/scroll to
			other areas of the graph.

		Why doesn&#39;t OED show all the meter/group data?
		Meters often get a new data point every 15 to 60 minutes and groups inherit that value. This means
			a given
			meter or group can have a lot of data points. For example, a meter reading every 20 minutes for a year
			has over
			26,000 data points. OED refers to these points as the original or raw meter data. There would be two
			main issues
			in showing you all the raw data. First, it would be
			significantly slower. All that data needs to be located in the OED database and then transferred across
			the
			network to your device. If you are on a mobile device you may be paying to transfer the data. Second,
			you would
			not be able to see all the points even if OED tried to graph them. Screen resolutions are in the
			hundreds to
			thousands of pixels (a single point on the screen) and the line graphics only get a subset of those
			pixels. That
			means OED cannot show more than hundreds to a few thousand points (if you have an HD screen). A massive
			number
			of points would be lost in viewing. Thus, OED averages the data on the site server to reduce the number
			of
			points it sends to your web browser for graphing. Thus, a point is the average energy usage across that
			time.
			Typically it averages across a day of data to be
			highly
			responsive. If you have limited data points for day averages then it will use smaller time intervals
			between
			points and will go to the original meter data when the number is small enough. This is still fast since
			the
			number of points to get is small and the number transmitted is also small. OED will average together
			multiple
			days if you have too many days to represent (if you are showing multiple years of data). These details
			are
			generally not important to you except to know that you are often looking at averaged data. Zooming in to
			a
			smaller time frame and redrawing or downloading the raw meter data for a graph are ways to see the
			original
			meter data.">

		Overview
		A line graphic shows each meter and group as a unique line showing usage across time. The following figure
			shows
			a line graphic of two meters (Meter 1 and Meter 2) and one group (Group 1 &amp; 2) where the group contains the
			two
			meters (the one sample time point from the hover values of Group 1 &amp; 2 is seen to be the sum of the two
			meters).
			Each line represents power usage at that time for the indicated meter/group, e.g., kW for electricity. To
			get
			this graphic, you
			click the
			&quot;Line&quot;
			choice
			(highlighted with a blue box).
		
		A line graphic can show an arbitrary choice and number of meters and groups. As described below, you can
			control
			the time frame (dates shown) on the line graphic.

		Usage
		You select the meters and/or groups to
			graph
			in the usual way. OED will display each meter and group as an individual line as shown in the figure above.
			For
			this section the graphics use synthetic data since values are easier to see. In this data, the meters have a
			constant value for long periods of time. Also, we will often use meters in these sample figures
			but the same ideas apply equally to groups.
			The time frame (days) shown on the x-axis will be the maximum time for all all meters and groups. If
			different
			meters and group have data for different time ranges then some lines will not span the entire length of the
			x-axis. The next figure shows this where the Meter C and Meter D do not span the full range of time on the
			graph
			so the beginning and end of the graphic does not have values for these two meters.
		
		
		This graphic also demonstrates another potential issue. If the values of one or more meters (or groups) are
			substantially
			less than another meter (or group) then the values for these meters will be very close to the x-axis. You
			can
			see these
			values by removing the values for the meters or groups with larger values. One way to do this is to remove a
			meter from graphing by clicking the &quot;X&quot; next to its name in the list (details on the meters/groups viewing help
			pages). This works but is slower since OED must recalculate the values via the server (see details below). It also means you won&#39;t see these meters/groups in other graphics
			since
			they were removed. A nice solution is to click on the name of the meter/group at the top of the line
			graphic. In
			the next figure, Meter D was clicked (highlighted with blue box) and the graph quickly redrew to
			what is shown with the y-axis scale re-calibrated for the remaining meters. The meter not being shown is in
			shadow font. You can click to remove as many lines as desired.
		
		You can click on a meter/group in shadow font to get it to quickly reappear on the line graphic. Note that
			going
			to another graphic will reset the
			lines shown so any hidden meters will show again.

		Scrolling and zooming
		Initially, OED shows the line graphic across all time that is available. Sometimes you want to look at a
			smaller
			time range. You can achieve this by zooming in the time (x) axis. This is done by clicking and dragging the
			rectangles with black border below the x-axis (highlighted with blue boxes in the figure below). As you
			slide
			the
			black rectangle, the parts of the x-axis (time) that is removed from the graph is show by a gray filled
			rectangle (highlighted in light blue boxes but goes also goes to center of rectangle but not highlighted
			since
			then hard to see other blue box). The white area between the gray rectangles is the time being shown.
			In
			the figure below the original time from of January through December was reduced to March through August.
		
		Note that the time range selected on a line graphic is also used for the Bar Graphic.
		Once you are zoomed in so gray areas are shown for the removed time, you can click within these areas to
			modify
			the time range shown but the behavior is a little more complex and likely to take time to learn to use.
		If only part of the time is shown, then you can scroll to see the other times. The total time displayed
			remains
			the same but the times included change as you scroll. You do this by clicking and dragging in the white area
			below the x-axis
			that shows the time being displayed (highlighted with blue box in the next figure). The next figure shows
			the
			process
			of dragging where the time displayed has now changed to May through October.
		

		If you zoom in significantly so the time range is much smaller than the original time range, the graph can
			become
			jagged due to having too few points. Also, you might want to return the graphic to its original, full time
			range. Both of these are discussed in the next section on the &quot;Redraw&quot; and &quot;Restore&quot; buttons.
		

		Redraw and Restore buttons
		The next figure shows the result of zooming in even farther so a limited time range of one month is shown. It
			also only shows one meter so the effects are easier to see.
		
		As you can see, the line has become vague because the time points are far apart. This happens due to the
			limited
			number of points available. (see below for the details of why). If you want to
			see
			this time range with more
			points then click the &quot;Redraw&quot; button (highlighted with a blue box) below the graph. The figure below shows
			the
			result of
			doing this where you can see that many more points are present. In this case it is using the original meter
			data
			which is spaced one hour apart.
		
		Note that once you do this, the time range is reset so you cannot zoom outward nor scroll to times outside
			the
			new range but you can zoom in farther so you can do this. If you want to see other time ranges, you can
			click
			the &quot;Restore&quot; button (highlighted with a blue
			box) and the graph will return to its original view with the time range including all meters. The result of
			doing this is shown in the next figure. Notice that it matches the Meter 2 line in the original figure at
			the
			top of this page.
		

		Details

		Exporting graph data
		You can export the data represented on a line graphic. You can use the line graph to get the time range and
			meters/groups you want. See the export help page for further information.

		Plotly graph controls
		As shown in the next figure, the Plotly (the underlying graphic package) graphical
			controls (highlighted by a blue box) are available for usage. The most useful might be the camera that
			allows
			you to download a PNG for the graph. If you hover over a Plotly control icon it will show its name. Note
			that
			using some of the other controls (zoom, pan, etc.) may cause
			unexpected behavior as OED is also using those features.
		

		Colors of lines
		The color of lines is always the same for a given meter or group. This means everyone sees the same color
			for a
			given meter or group whenever it is graphed. The line colors are chosen to try to provide contrast
			between
			different lines. They are also designed to
			give some differentiation between meters and groups when possible. OED tries to show meters in lighter
			colors
			and
			groups in darker colors. This is not guaranteed as colors are reused between groups and meters if the number
			in
			either category becomes large. OED also tries to give a unique color to each line but that may not
			happen when
			the number of meters and groups is large. Note both of these depend on the number of meters and groups
			at the
			OED site and not the number being shown. Finally, a given meter or group will have the same color on the
			line,
			bar and map graphic.

		Why do I need to Redraw and Restore?
		OED is designed to be fast on any reasonable device. When you are zooming and scrolling within a line
			graphic,
			the work is all done in your web browser so it will have a very fast response rate. If OED recalculated
			the
			points shown as you zoomed/scrolled then it would be substantially slower, esp. if it needed to access
			the
			site&#39;s server to get new
			data. OED could try to determine when you are done zooming/scrolling and then recalculate the points but
			it is
			very difficult to determine when that has happened given users often pause during these operations.
			Thus, to be
			fast and allow you to get high quality line graphs, OED needs you to let it know when you are done and
			need the
			points displayed to be reset. The &quot;Redraw&quot; button is how you do that. You can also tell OED when you want
			to go
			back to the original graphic via the &quot;Restore&quot; button. This allows you to see all the data and/or
			zoom/scroll to
			other areas of the graph.

		Why doesn&#39;t OED show all the meter/group data?
		Meters often get a new data point every 15 to 60 minutes and groups inherit that value. This means
			a given
			meter or group can have a lot of data points. For example, a meter reading every 20 minutes for a year
			has over
			26,000 data points. OED refers to these points as the original or raw meter data. There would be two
			main issues
			in showing you all the raw data. First, it would be
			significantly slower. All that data needs to be located in the OED database and then transferred across
			the
			network to your device. If you are on a mobile device you may be paying to transfer the data. Second,
			you would
			not be able to see all the points even if OED tried to graph them. Screen resolutions are in the
			hundreds to
			thousands of pixels (a single point on the screen) and the line graphics only get a subset of those
			pixels. That
			means OED cannot show more than hundreds to a few thousand points (if you have an HD screen). A massive
			number
			of points would be lost in viewing. Thus, OED averages the data on the site server to reduce the number
			of
			points it sends to your web browser for graphing. Thus, a point is the average energy usage across that
			time.
			Typically it averages across a day of data to be
			highly
			responsive. If you have limited data points for day averages then it will use smaller time intervals
			between
			points and will go to the original meter data when the number is small enough. This is still fast since
			the
			number of points to get is small and the number transmitted is also small. OED will average together
			multiple
			days if you have too many days to represent (if you are showing multiple years of data). These details
			are
			generally not important to you except to know that you are often looking at averaged data. Zooming in to
			a
			smaller time frame and redrawing or downloading the raw meter data for a graph are ways to see the
			original
			meter data.">

		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
		<p>A line graphic shows each meter and group as a unique line showing usage across time. The following figure
			shows
			a line graphic of two meters (Meter 1 and Meter 2) and one group (Group 1 & 2) where the group contains the
			two
			meters (the one sample time point from the hover values of Group 1 & 2 is seen to be the sum of the two
			meters).
			Each line represents power usage at that time for the indicated meter/group, e.g., kW for electricity. To
			get
			this graphic, you
			click the
			"Line"
			choice
			(highlighted with a blue box).</p>
		<img alt="line graphic with two meters and a group of those meters"
			src="../images/OEDLineGraphicRealDataHelp.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>A line graphic can show an arbitrary choice and number of meters and groups. As described below, you can
			control
			the time frame (dates shown) on the line graphic.</p>

		<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
		<p>You select the <a href="../graphingMeters/">meters</a> and/or <a href="../graphingGroups/">groups</a> to
			graph
			in the usual way. OED will display each meter and group as an individual line as shown in the figure above.
			For
			this section the graphics use synthetic data since values are easier to see. In this data, the meters have a
			constant value for long periods of time. Also, we will often use meters in these sample figures
			but the same ideas apply equally to groups.
			The time frame (days) shown on the x-axis will be the maximum time for all all meters and groups. If
			different
			meters and group have data for different time ranges then some lines will not span the entire length of the
			x-axis. The next figure shows this where the Meter C and Meter D do not span the full range of time on the
			graph
			so the beginning and end of the graphic does not have values for these two meters.
		</p>
		<img alt="sample line graphic where the meters data is different time frames" src="../images/OEDLineVaryTime.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>This graphic also demonstrates another potential issue. If the values of one or more meters (or groups) are
			substantially
			less than another meter (or group) then the values for these meters will be very close to the x-axis. You
			can
			see these
			values by removing the values for the meters or groups with larger values. One way to do this is to remove a
			meter from graphing by clicking the "X" next to its name in the list (details on the <a
				href="../graphingMeters/">meters</a>/<a href="../graphingGroups/">groups</a> viewing help
			pages). This works but is slower since OED must recalculate the values via the server (see <a
				href="#details">details</a> below). It also means you won't see these meters/groups in other graphics
			since
			they were removed. A nice solution is to click on the name of the meter/group at the top of the line
			graphic. In
			the next figure, Meter D was clicked (highlighted with blue box) and the graph quickly redrew to
			what is shown with the y-axis scale re-calibrated for the remaining meters. The meter not being shown is in
			shadow font. You can click to remove as many lines as desired.</p>

			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>You can click on a meter/group in shadow font to get it to quickly reappear on the line graphic. Note that
			going
			to another graphic will reset the
			lines shown so any hidden meters will show again.</p>

		<h3 id="scrollZoom">Scrolling and zooming</h3>
		<p>Initially, OED shows the line graphic across all time that is available. Sometimes you want to look at a
			smaller
			time range. You can achieve this by zooming in the time (x) axis. This is done by clicking and dragging the
			rectangles with black border below the x-axis (highlighted with blue boxes in the figure below). As you
			slide
			the
			black rectangle, the parts of the x-axis (time) that is removed from the graph is show by a gray filled
			rectangle (highlighted in light blue boxes but goes also goes to center of rectangle but not highlighted
			since
			then hard to see other blue box). The white area between the gray rectangles is the time being shown.
			In
			the figure below the original time from of January through December was reduced to March through August.</p>
		<img alt="reducing time shown in a line graphic" src="../images/OEDLineReducedTime.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>Note that the time range selected on a line graphic is also used for the Bar Graphic.</p>
		<p>Once you are zoomed in so gray areas are shown for the removed time, you can click within these areas to
			modify
			the time range shown but the behavior is a little more complex and likely to take time to learn to use.</p>
		<p>If only part of the time is shown, then you can scroll to see the other times. The total time displayed
			remains
			the same but the times included change as you scroll. You do this by clicking and dragging in the white area
			below the x-axis
			that shows the time being displayed (highlighted with blue box in the next figure). The next figure shows
			the
			process
			of dragging where the time displayed has now changed to May through October.</p>
		<img alt="scrolling time in a line graphic" src="../images/OEDLineScrolled.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">

		<p>If you zoom in significantly so the time range is much smaller than the original time range, the graph can
			become
			jagged due to having too few points. Also, you might want to return the graphic to its original, full time
			range. Both of these are discussed in the next section on the "Redraw" and "Restore" buttons.
		</p>

		<h3 id="redrawRestore">Redraw and Restore buttons</h3>
		<p>The next figure shows the result of zooming in even farther so a limited time range of one month is shown. It
			also only shows one meter so the effects are easier to see.</p>
		<img alt="zooming to a limited time range on a line graphic" src="../images/OEDLineZoomed.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>As you can see, the line has become vague because the time points are far apart. This happens due to the
			limited
			number of points available. (see <a href="#redrawDetails">below</a> for the details of why). If you want to
			see
			this time range with more
			points then click the "Redraw" button (highlighted with a blue box) below the graph. The figure below shows
			the
			result of
			doing this where you can see that many more points are present. In this case it is using the original meter
			data
			which is spaced one hour apart.</p>
		<img alt="result of redrawing a line graphic" src="../images/OEDLineRedraw.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>Note that once you do this, the time range is reset so you cannot zoom outward nor scroll to times outside
			the
			new range but you can zoom in farther so you can do this. If you want to see other time ranges, you can
			click
			the "Restore" button (highlighted with a blue
			box) and the graph will return to its original view with the time range including all meters. The result of
			doing this is shown in the next figure. Notice that it matches the Meter 2 line in the original figure at
			the
			top of this page.</p>

		<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

		<h3>Exporting graph data</h3>
		<p>You can export the data represented on a line graphic. You can use the line graph to get the time range and
			meters/groups you want. See the <a href="../export/">export help page</a> for further information.</p>

		<h3>Plotly graph controls</h3>
		<p>As shown in the next figure, the Plotly (the underlying graphic package) graphical
			controls (highlighted by a blue box) are available for usage. The most useful might be the camera that
			allows
			you to download a PNG for the graph. If you hover over a Plotly control icon it will show its name. Note
			that
			using some of the other controls (zoom, pan, etc.) may cause
			unexpected behavior as OED is also using those features.</p>
		<img alt="Plotly controls" src="../images/plotlyControls.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">

		<h3 id="colors">Colors of lines</h3>
		<p>The color of lines is always the same for a given meter or group. This means everyone sees the same color
			for a
			given meter or group whenever it is graphed. The line colors are chosen to try to provide contrast
			between
			different lines. They are also designed to
			give some differentiation between meters and groups when possible. OED tries to show meters in lighter
			colors
			and
			groups in darker colors. This is not guaranteed as colors are reused between groups and meters if the number
			in
			either category becomes large. OED also tries to give a unique color to each line but that may not
			happen when
			the number of meters and groups is large. Note both of these depend on the number of meters and groups
			at the
			OED site and not the number being shown. Finally, a given meter or group will have the same color on the
			line,
			bar and map graphic.</p>

		<h3 id="redrawDetails">Why do I need to Redraw and Restore?</h3>
		<p>OED is designed to be fast on any reasonable device. When you are zooming and scrolling within a line
			graphic,
			the work is all done in your web browser so it will have a very fast response rate. If OED recalculated
			the
			points shown as you zoomed/scrolled then it would be substantially slower, esp. if it needed to access
			the
			site's server to get new
			data. OED could try to determine when you are done zooming/scrolling and then recalculate the points but
			it is
			very difficult to determine when that has happened given users often pause during these operations.
			Thus, to be
			fast and allow you to get high quality line graphs, OED needs you to let it know when you are done and
			need the
			points displayed to be reset. The "Redraw" button is how you do that. You can also tell OED when you want
			to go
			back to the original graphic via the "Restore" button. This allows you to see all the data and/or
			zoom/scroll to
			other areas of the graph.</p>

		<h3 id="averaging">Why doesn't OED show all the meter/group data?</h3>
		<p>Meters often get a new data point every 15 to 60 minutes and groups inherit that value. This means
			a given
			meter or group can have a lot of data points. For example, a meter reading every 20 minutes for a year
			has over
			26,000 data points. OED refers to these points as the original or raw meter data. There would be two
			main issues
			in showing you all the raw data. First, it would be
			significantly slower. All that data needs to be located in the OED database and then transferred across
			the
			network to your device. If you are on a mobile device you may be paying to transfer the data. Second,
			you would
			not be able to see all the points even if OED tried to graph them. Screen resolutions are in the
			hundreds to
			thousands of pixels (a single point on the screen) and the line graphics only get a subset of those
			pixels. That
			means OED cannot show more than hundreds to a few thousand points (if you have an HD screen). A massive
			number
			of points would be lost in viewing. Thus, OED averages the data on the site server to reduce the number
			of
			points it sends to your web browser for graphing. Thus, a point is the average energy usage across that
			time.
			Typically it averages across a day of data to be
			highly
			responsive. If you have limited data points for day averages then it will use smaller time intervals
			between
			points and will go to the original meter data when the number is small enough. This is still fast since
			the
			number of points to get is small and the number transmitted is also small. OED will average together
			multiple
			days if you have too many days to represent (if you are showing multiple years of data). These details
			are
			generally not important to you except to know that you are often looking at averaged data. Zooming in to
			a
			smaller time frame and redrawing or downloading the raw meter data for a graph are ways to see the
			original
			meter data.</p>
