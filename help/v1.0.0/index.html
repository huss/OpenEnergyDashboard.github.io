	<h1>Help Overview</h1>
	<p>These pages provide help about the Open Energy Dashboard (OED) system. You can use the links at the top on
		any
		help page to go the
		appropriate section for your question or look at the description/links below. Note that each version of OED
		has
		its own help pages. You will be taken to the latest version on the website and the version of OED you are
		running when you get help on an OED page. You can look at the help for other versions by using the "Help
		versions" dropdown menu at the top of all help pages. Some help pages do not exist in all versions of OED.
		For
		example, a feature may not have existed in earlier versions so there is not help page for that feature. If
		you
		select another version and the web browser gives you a "404 File not found" error then this is likely the
		case.
		You can use the web browser's back button to return to the page you were on to get back to the help system.

	<p>The help icon
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="help icon" src="./images/helpIcon.png" width="17" height="18" style="min-width:17px; display: inline">
		can be clicked within OED to reveal information about the features(s) near the
		<!-- Need to override the default size for most images on pages. -->
		<img alt="help icon" src="./images/helpIcon.png" width="17" height="18" style="min-width:17px; display: inline">.
		That information generally contains a
		brief overview and links to help pages directly related to the feature being described. This context
		sensitive help can aid one while working with OED and leads to appropriate help pages.

	<p>OED uses JavaScript for many features. You must have JavaScript enabled for the web browser page that
		contains
		OED. If JavaScript is not enabled then you will see "OED requires JavaScript to run correctly. Please enable
		JavaScript." when you load OED into the web browser page.</p>
