	<h1>Graphing Groups (Help)</h1>

	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>A group in OED represents the aggregation (sum) of the meters and groups it represents. The following figure
		visually represents the ideas of a group in OED. It is a simplified representation of a college campus.</p>
	<img alt="graphic of OED groups" src="./images/groupIdea.png">
	<p>The green circles at the top represent meters and the rectangles represent groups. The lines indicate what items
		are
		included in a given group. Here is a description of some of the groups:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The group "Dorm A" (in pink) is the sum of the five meters with lines going into the box around its name.
			It logically represents the total energy usage for this dorm.
			Groups "Dorm B" (yellow) and "Dorm C" (dark pink) are similar but each have four meters in the group that
			form them. This shows you can have any number of meters within a group.</li>
		<li>The group "Dining Hall" (orange) has only one meter in it so its values are equivalent to that meter. Here
			the energy usage is represented by a single meter.</li>
		<li>The group "Food Services" (yellow-orange) is the sum of three meters. Two of those meters come from directly
			including them
			into the group: One that is part of "Dorm A" and one that is part of "Dorm B". This shows that meters can be
			part of multiple groups. The final meter comes from including the "Dining Hall" (orange) group. This shows
			that a group can include a mix of meters and groups.</li>
		<li>The group "All Residential" (red) is the sum of the groups "Dorm A", "Food Services", "Dorm B" and "Dorm C".
			This logically represents the total energy usage for the residential parts of the campus. This shows that
			groups can be formed as the sum of other groups. OED will automatically include all the meters in the groups
			you include and aggregate them together. In this case it will be the sum of the 14 meters that have direct
			lines coming out of them. Note OED will not double count the meters included in the "Food Services" group
			that are also in groups "Dorm A" and Dorm B". A meter is only counted once even if it appears to be included
			multiple times.</li>
		<li>The group "All Academic" (light blue) is the sum of an unspecified number of meters and groups. It
			represents the energy usage on the academic (labs, classroom, etc.) part of campus.</li>
		<li>The group "All Campus" (light green) is the sum of the groups "All Residential" and "All Academic". It again
			includes meters from other groups and again shows that any level of hierarchy of meters and groups is
			allowed.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The important idea behind groups is they allow a site to create arbitrary combinations that can represent the
		total
		usage of energy for an area of an organization. As OED rolls out inclusion of all resource types (coming future
		release), groups will allow
		for combining different types of energy usage to get the total energy usage across groups. For example, a
		building
		might have a meter for electricity, a meter for natural gas and a meter for steam. A group that combined these
		meters would represent the total energy used across these three energy sources.
	</p>

	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<p>Each graphic page has a dropdown menu for the available groups as shown in this figure:</p>
	<img alt="meter dropdown" src="./images/groupDropdown.png" style="height: 20vh; min-height: 300px;">
	<p>Note if the list of groups is long, you may need to scroll down to get to the one you want. You can do an
		incremental
		search for any group by typing in the input area at the top of the dropdown menu to limit the groups shown
		to the ones that match what you type. The search will occur anywhere in the group name (not just the start) and
		is not case
		sensitive. This can still be done when groups are already selected and shown at the top of the group dropdown.
		This
		is
		shown in the next figure where Group 7 & 8 was already selected and "8" was typed in the dropdown to find Group
		1 & 2 & 7 & 8 (excluded Group 1 & 2 in this case).</p>
	<img alt="meter dropdown" src="./images/groupDropdownSearch.png" style="height: 20vh; min-height: 300px;">
	<p>You can select any group by clicking on it so it shows up on the graphic on this page and appear in the list at
		the
		top of the group dropdown. The choice of groups will
		remain as you change the graphic you are displaying.</p>
	<p>If you want to remove a group from being graphed, you click the "x" to the left of its name in the list at the
		top of the dropdown menu.</p>

	<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
	<p>The hope is that the name of a group gives you a good idea of what it represents. However, you may want to see
		the underlying groups and meters within a group. The <a href="groupViewing.html">Group Content page</a> can show
		this.</p>
	<p>At the current time (OED version 0.7), you cannot graph a group on a map. This limitation will be going away in a
		future release of OED.</p>
