		Overview
		A compare graphic shows each meter and group as its own bar graphic with two bars where one is for past usage
			and
			one is for current usage. The past usage immediately precedes the current period. The title of each bar
			graphic
			indicates the percentage change in usage between these
			two bars. The common usage allows for the selection of multiple meters/groups to see the trend in usage and
			to
			compare across them to see which ones are improving more than others.
			The following figure shows a compare graphic for Meter 7 and Meter 8.
			
			Each bar represents one week of data so it is
			the total usage of the indicated meter for that week. Since it is total usage, the units are for
			energy, e.g., kWh for electricity. To get this graphic, you click the &quot;Compare&quot; choice
			(highlighted with a blue box) from the &quot;Select a graph type&quot; dropdown menu.
		
		
		A compare graphic can show an arbitrary choice and number of meters and groups. As described below, you can
			control
			the time frame for the comparison on the compare graphic.
		Usage
		You select the meters and/or groups to
			graph
			in the usual way. OED will display each meter and group as a unique graphic with two bars. The bar on the
			left
			is for the past usage period (&quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Last week&quot; or &quot;Last four weeks&quot;) and the bar on the right is for
			the
			current usage period (&quot;Today&quot;, &quot;This week&quot; or &quot;These four weeks&quot;). As
			seen in the figure above, the title displays the meter/group involved and the percentage change in usage
			from
			the
			previous to current period. For example, Meter 8 has a percentage change of -3% because the ratio of
			the current to previous is 2232 / 2292 = 0.9738 which means the change is 0.9738 - 1 = -0.0262. OED rounds
			to the nearest whole number as a percentage which gives -3% here . OED
			colors the tile green if usage went down (negative percentage) and red if usage went up (positive
			percentage) or
			stayed the same (0%).
		
		You can select the time range in days for comparison by clicking one of the
			predefined time ranges (highlighted with a blue box in the next figure) where the choices are &quot;Day&quot;, &quot;Week&quot;
			(default) or
			&quot;4 Weeks&quot;. The figure below is the result of clicking on the &quot;4 Week&quot; choice (it was &quot;Week&quot; in the figure
			above).
		
		When you hover over one of the bars, it says &quot;used this time yesterday&quot; or &quot;used so far today&quot; (in the case
			of
			&quot;Day&quot;). This is meant to indicate that OED is giving you data for as much of the time period you have used
			up to
			this point in time. This means that the values generally change if you look at them at a later time. Keep in
			mind that OED meter data is updated as frequently as the site has arranged (often
			every hour)
			so you will not actually see the result to the exact current time. Here is how each of the time intervals is
			calculated:
		
			&quot;Day&quot;: Today begins at the midnight immediately preceding the current time. Yesterday begins at midnight
				of
				the day before. For example, if the current date/time is Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 (February 18 is
				a
				Thursday in 2021 as a reference) then today is from
				Thursday, February 18 at midnight to Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 and yesterday is Wednesday, February
				17
				at midnight to Thursday, February 17 at 10:13.
			&quot;Week&quot;: This week begins at midnight on the Sunday immediately preceding the current day/time (meaning
				if it
				is Sunday then start at midnight of that Sunday). Last week begins at midnight of the previous Sunday.
				For
				example, if the current date/time is Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 then this week is from
				Sunday, February 14 at midnight to Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 and last week is Sunday, February 7
				at midnight to Thursday, February 11 at 10:13.
			&quot;4 Weeks&quot;: These four weeks begin three Sundays before the one at midnight for this week and the last
				four
				weeks begins four Sundays earlier at midnight. For
				example, if the current date/time is Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 then these four weeks is from
				Sunday, January 24 at midnight to Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 and last week is Sunday, December 27
				at midnight to Thursday, January 21 at 10:13.
		
		This means that you are missing the end of one unit for each time frame. Thus, in &quot;Day&quot; you see part of a
			day, in
			&quot;Week&quot; you see part of a week and in &quot;4 Weeks&quot; you see 3+ weeks of data in each bar. Note that if you look
			soon
			after midnight on Sunday then day and week comparisons will have low values since very little time has past.
		
		To make comparisons across multiple meters/groups easier, OED allows the ordering of the graphs to be
			changed.
			The next figure shows the result of clicking the &quot;Sort&quot; dropdown menu (highlighted with a blue box) that
			allows the user to choose the
			ordering of the comparison graphics.
		
		The choices are:
		
			&quot;Alphabetically&quot;: This places them alphabetically by the name of the meter/group.
			&quot;Ascending&quot;: This places the meter/group with the greatest reduction in usage first and
				continues until it places the one with the worst reduction in usage last. Note that a reduction leads to
				a
				smaller percentage change where negative values are even better. Thus, negative values represent an
				actual
				reduction and positive value represents an increase in usage. The common usage is to show who reduced
				consumption the most.
			&quot;Descending&quot; (default): Similar to &quot;Ascending&quot; but in the opposite order. The common usage is to
				show who reduced consumption the least (which might actually be an increase in consumption).
		

		Details

		Missing data
		Since OED starts calculating the current usage from the current time, there are circumstances where issues
			can
			occur. If any meter/group being graphed is missing recent data then the calculated values will be low and
			the
			comparison skewed (assuming the previous period has all its data). This is a special case of any time a
			meter/group is missing data but more common as the
			acquisition of new data might be delayed due to hardware/network/software issues. OED hopes to address this
			issue in a future release.

		Why 4 weeks?
		OED deliberately chose 4 week intervals rather than the more common month. When you are comparing two
			different
			interval periods and the number of days vary then the total usage will vary even if the underlying usage is
			constant. This happens when comparing months because different months have a different number of days. (and
			February can vary by year!) To avoid
			this issue, OED used 4
			weeks consistently throughout.">

		Overview
		A compare graphic shows each meter and group as its own bar graphic with two bars where one is for past usage
			and
			one is for current usage. The past usage immediately precedes the current period. The title of each bar
			graphic
			indicates the percentage change in usage between these
			two bars. The common usage allows for the selection of multiple meters/groups to see the trend in usage and
			to
			compare across them to see which ones are improving more than others.
			The following figure shows a compare graphic for Meter 7 and Meter 8.
			
			Each bar represents one week of data so it is
			the total usage of the indicated meter for that week. Since it is total usage, the units are for
			energy, e.g., kWh for electricity. To get this graphic, you click the &quot;Compare&quot; choice
			(highlighted with a blue box) from the &quot;Select a graph type&quot; dropdown menu.
		
		
		A compare graphic can show an arbitrary choice and number of meters and groups. As described below, you can
			control
			the time frame for the comparison on the compare graphic.
		Usage
		You select the meters and/or groups to
			graph
			in the usual way. OED will display each meter and group as a unique graphic with two bars. The bar on the
			left
			is for the past usage period (&quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Last week&quot; or &quot;Last four weeks&quot;) and the bar on the right is for
			the
			current usage period (&quot;Today&quot;, &quot;This week&quot; or &quot;These four weeks&quot;). As
			seen in the figure above, the title displays the meter/group involved and the percentage change in usage
			from
			the
			previous to current period. For example, Meter 8 has a percentage change of -3% because the ratio of
			the current to previous is 2232 / 2292 = 0.9738 which means the change is 0.9738 - 1 = -0.0262. OED rounds
			to the nearest whole number as a percentage which gives -3% here . OED
			colors the tile green if usage went down (negative percentage) and red if usage went up (positive
			percentage) or
			stayed the same (0%).
		
		You can select the time range in days for comparison by clicking one of the
			predefined time ranges (highlighted with a blue box in the next figure) where the choices are &quot;Day&quot;, &quot;Week&quot;
			(default) or
			&quot;4 Weeks&quot;. The figure below is the result of clicking on the &quot;4 Week&quot; choice (it was &quot;Week&quot; in the figure
			above).
		
		When you hover over one of the bars, it says &quot;used this time yesterday&quot; or &quot;used so far today&quot; (in the case
			of
			&quot;Day&quot;). This is meant to indicate that OED is giving you data for as much of the time period you have used
			up to
			this point in time. This means that the values generally change if you look at them at a later time. Keep in
			mind that OED meter data is updated as frequently as the site has arranged (often
			every hour)
			so you will not actually see the result to the exact current time. Here is how each of the time intervals is
			calculated:
		
			&quot;Day&quot;: Today begins at the midnight immediately preceding the current time. Yesterday begins at midnight
				of
				the day before. For example, if the current date/time is Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 (February 18 is
				a
				Thursday in 2021 as a reference) then today is from
				Thursday, February 18 at midnight to Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 and yesterday is Wednesday, February
				17
				at midnight to Thursday, February 17 at 10:13.
			&quot;Week&quot;: This week begins at midnight on the Sunday immediately preceding the current day/time (meaning
				if it
				is Sunday then start at midnight of that Sunday). Last week begins at midnight of the previous Sunday.
				For
				example, if the current date/time is Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 then this week is from
				Sunday, February 14 at midnight to Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 and last week is Sunday, February 7
				at midnight to Thursday, February 11 at 10:13.
			&quot;4 Weeks&quot;: These four weeks begin three Sundays before the one at midnight for this week and the last
				four
				weeks begins four Sundays earlier at midnight. For
				example, if the current date/time is Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 then these four weeks is from
				Sunday, January 24 at midnight to Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 and last week is Sunday, December 27
				at midnight to Thursday, January 21 at 10:13.
		
		This means that you are missing the end of one unit for each time frame. Thus, in &quot;Day&quot; you see part of a
			day, in
			&quot;Week&quot; you see part of a week and in &quot;4 Weeks&quot; you see 3+ weeks of data in each bar. Note that if you look
			soon
			after midnight on Sunday then day and week comparisons will have low values since very little time has past.
		
		To make comparisons across multiple meters/groups easier, OED allows the ordering of the graphs to be
			changed.
			The next figure shows the result of clicking the &quot;Sort&quot; dropdown menu (highlighted with a blue box) that
			allows the user to choose the
			ordering of the comparison graphics.
		
		The choices are:
		
			&quot;Alphabetically&quot;: This places them alphabetically by the name of the meter/group.
			&quot;Ascending&quot;: This places the meter/group with the greatest reduction in usage first and
				continues until it places the one with the worst reduction in usage last. Note that a reduction leads to
				a
				smaller percentage change where negative values are even better. Thus, negative values represent an
				actual
				reduction and positive value represents an increase in usage. The common usage is to show who reduced
				consumption the most.
			&quot;Descending&quot; (default): Similar to &quot;Ascending&quot; but in the opposite order. The common usage is to
				show who reduced consumption the least (which might actually be an increase in consumption).
		

		Details

		Missing data
		Since OED starts calculating the current usage from the current time, there are circumstances where issues
			can
			occur. If any meter/group being graphed is missing recent data then the calculated values will be low and
			the
			comparison skewed (assuming the previous period has all its data). This is a special case of any time a
			meter/group is missing data but more common as the
			acquisition of new data might be delayed due to hardware/network/software issues. OED hopes to address this
			issue in a future release.

		Why 4 weeks?
		OED deliberately chose 4 week intervals rather than the more common month. When you are comparing two
			different
			interval periods and the number of days vary then the total usage will vary even if the underlying usage is
			constant. This happens when comparing months because different months have a different number of days. (and
			February can vary by year!) To avoid
			this issue, OED used 4
			weeks consistently throughout.">

		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
		<p>A compare graphic shows each meter and group as its own bar graphic with two bars where one is for past usage
			and
			one is for current usage. The past usage immediately precedes the current period. The title of each bar
			graphic
			indicates the percentage change in usage between these
			two bars. The common usage allows for the selection of multiple meters/groups to see the trend in usage and
			to
			compare across them to see which ones are improving more than others.
			The following figure shows a compare graphic for Meter 7 and Meter 8.
			<!-- The following figure shows
		a compare graphic for four groups. It would work equally well with meters but it is common to use groups to
		combine the data to represent a given area in the organization (building, etc.)  -->
			Each bar represents one week of data so it is
			the total usage of the indicated meter for that week. Since it is total usage, the units are for
			energy, e.g., kWh for electricity. To get this graphic, you click the "Compare" choice
			(highlighted with a blue box) from the "Select a graph type" dropdown menu.
		</p>
		<img alt="sample compare graphic for four groups" src="../images/OEDCompareGraphicRealDataHelp.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>A compare graphic can show an arbitrary choice and number of meters and groups. As described below, you can
			control
			the time frame for the comparison on the compare graphic.</p>
		<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
		<p>You select the <a href="../graphingMeters/">meters</a> and/or <a href="../graphingGroups/">groups</a> to
			graph
			in the usual way. OED will display each meter and group as a unique graphic with two bars. The bar on the
			left
			is for the past usage period ("Yesterday", "Last week" or "Last four weeks") and the bar on the right is for
			the
			current usage period ("Today", "This week" or "These four weeks"). As
			seen in the figure above, the title displays the meter/group involved and the percentage change in usage
			from
			the
			previous to current period. For example, Meter 8 has a percentage change of -3% because the ratio of
			the current to previous is 2232 / 2292 = 0.9738 which means the change is 0.9738 - 1 = -0.0262. OED rounds
			to the nearest whole number as a percentage which gives -3% here . OED
			colors the tile green if usage went down (negative percentage) and red if usage went up (positive
			percentage) or
			stayed the same (0%).
		</p>
		<p>You can select the time range in days for comparison by clicking one of the
			predefined time ranges (highlighted with a blue box in the next figure) where the choices are "Day", "Week"
			(default) or
			"4 Weeks". The figure below is the result of clicking on the "4 Week" choice (it was "Week" in the figure
			above).</p>
		<img alt="sample week compare graphic" src="../images/OEDCompare4Weeks.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>When you hover over one of the bars, it says "used this time yesterday" or "used so far today" (in the case
			of
			"Day"). This is meant to indicate that OED is giving you data for as much of the time period you have used
			up to
			this point in time. This means that the values generally change if you look at them at a later time. Keep in
			mind that OED meter data is updated as frequently as the site has arranged (often
			every hour)
			so you will not actually see the result to the exact current time. Here is how each of the time intervals is
			calculated:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>"Day": Today begins at the midnight immediately preceding the current time. Yesterday begins at midnight
				of
				the day before. For example, if the current date/time is Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 (February 18 is
				a
				Thursday in 2021 as a reference) then today is from
				Thursday, February 18 at midnight to Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 and yesterday is Wednesday, February
				17
				at midnight to Thursday, February 17 at 10:13.</li>
			<li>"Week": This week begins at midnight on the Sunday immediately preceding the current day/time (meaning
				if it
				is Sunday then start at midnight of that Sunday). Last week begins at midnight of the previous Sunday.
				For
				example, if the current date/time is Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 then this week is from
				Sunday, February 14 at midnight to Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 and last week is Sunday, February 7
				at midnight to Thursday, February 11 at 10:13.</li>
			<li>"4 Weeks": These four weeks begin three Sundays before the one at midnight for this week and the last
				four
				weeks begins four Sundays earlier at midnight. For
				example, if the current date/time is Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 then these four weeks is from
				Sunday, January 24 at midnight to Thursday, February 18 at 10:13 and last week is Sunday, December 27
				at midnight to Thursday, January 21 at 10:13.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This means that you are missing the end of one unit for each time frame. Thus, in "Day" you see part of a
			day, in
			"Week" you see part of a week and in "4 Weeks" you see 3+ weeks of data in each bar. Note that if you look
			soon
			after midnight on Sunday then day and week comparisons will have low values since very little time has past.
		</p>
		<p>To make comparisons across multiple meters/groups easier, OED allows the ordering of the graphs to be
			changed.
			The next figure shows the result of clicking the "Sort" dropdown menu (highlighted with a blue box) that
			allows the user to choose the
			ordering of the comparison graphics.</p>
		<img alt="sorting choices for compare graphic" src="../images/OEDCompareSort.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>The choices are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>"Alphabetically": This places them alphabetically by the name of the meter/group.</li>
			<li>"Ascending": This places the meter/group with the greatest reduction in usage first and
				continues until it places the one with the worst reduction in usage last. Note that a reduction leads to
				a
				smaller percentage change where negative values are even better. Thus, negative values represent an
				actual
				reduction and positive value represents an increase in usage. The common usage is to show who reduced
				consumption the most.</li>
			<li>"Descending" (default): Similar to "Ascending" but in the opposite order. The common usage is to
				show who reduced consumption the least (which might actually be an increase in consumption).</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

		<h3>Missing data</h3>
		<p>Since OED starts calculating the current usage from the current time, there are circumstances where issues
			can
			occur. If any meter/group being graphed is missing recent data then the calculated values will be low and
			the
			comparison skewed (assuming the previous period has all its data). This is a special case of any time a
			meter/group is missing data but more common as the
			acquisition of new data might be delayed due to hardware/network/software issues. OED hopes to address this
			issue in a future release.</p>

		<h3 id="fourWeeks">Why 4 weeks?</h3>
		<p>OED deliberately chose 4 week intervals rather than the more common month. When you are comparing two
			different
			interval periods and the number of days vary then the total usage will vary even if the underlying usage is
			constant. This happens when comparing months because different months have a different number of days. (and
			February can vary by year!) To avoid
			this issue, OED used 4
			weeks consistently throughout.</p>
