These features are only available to select people who oversee the OED site (called admins) so this information is not usually of interest to a general user.





		Overview
		See the map graphic page for general information on OED and maps. Note that
			unlike
			many systems, using maps in OED does not require any additional software nor the use of GIS. Instead, you
			load a
			graphical image you want to use as a map. This can be anything from a real map, a stylized graphic with
			buildings and features of interest to an arbitrary graphic. Once loaded, you calibrate this map by informing
			OED
			about a few GPS coordinates for items on the map. OED will automatically allow users to place meters on a
			graph
			as long as you have input the GPS data for that meter. OED allows sites
			to
			have
			as many maps as they wish and maps can overlap. For example, you could have maps with two different sites
			and a
			map that zooms in to show details of one of the sites.
		This greatly simplified
			system is based on a simple assumption that the map is flat. In actuality, the world is a sphere so that it
			is
			curved. However, over modest distances, it is effectively flat. This is why local maps don&#39;t appear warped
			but
			ones of the entire global make some areas look much larger than they really are. Since most maps involving a
			site are over very modest distances this works very well. If you want a large geographical area map then see
			circle placement below on making this work. Note that you can have
			different maps that are very
			far apart without any issue. It is only a single map covering a large area that causes issues.
		For this system to work, OED needs to know the rotation of each map from true north. This allows OED to align
			the
			real world longitude and latitude (used in GPS) with the map graphic. OED internally stores this rotation as
			the
			angle from true north on the map graphic to straight up on the map graphic going in the counterclockwise
			direction. OED can then use this angle to properly calibrate the map and place items on the map (see below).
			While this is fully functional within OED, there is not yet an admin interface to set the rotation angle. We
			plan to soon add the needed interface so the admin can set the rotation angle for each map. When
			that is done, this help page will be enhanced to explain how to get the rotation angle and place it in OED
			for a
			given map. Until that time you should contact OED for help in dealing with rotated maps.

		Usage
		If you click on the &quot;Maps&quot; button in the top, right of the main OED screen you will go to the maps page shown
			below. This shows the page when no maps are on the site. Click the blue &quot;Create a Map&quot; button to begin the
			process of uploading a map.
		
		You should now be on the page shown below. Click on the &quot;Browse ...&quot; button (highlighted with a blue box) to
			open
			a standard web browser pop up to select a file. Choose the graphical image of your map. Note the image can
			be of
			types JPEG or PNG (the file extension does not matter but the contents must be one of these two image
			types).
			OED will allow you to choose other types of files and tell you the upload is complete but you
			will find the file image does not appear on the next step. There are many programs/apps that will allow you
			to
			convert to one of these two types of graphical images. Once you have uploaded the map image, use the box
			immediately below (labeled &quot;Define a name for the map:&quot;) to name your map. Note this is the name that a user
			will see (it can be edited later). In this example, &quot;Happy Place&quot; was used. When
			you are ready, click the &quot;Save and continue&quot; button to complete this step.
		
		You should then see the confirmation popup shown below. The exact look differs depending on your web browser.
			It
			may or may not show the URL and it will definitely differ from localhost:3000 (special URL for development).
			Click &quot;OK&quot; to continue the process.
		
		You should now be on the map calibration page shown below. This page allows you to enter the GPS coordinates
			for
			places on the map so OED can map locations on the map to locations on the globe (world map). You should
			place
			your curser that will appear as a &quot;+&quot; symbol at the point on the map that you wish to enter the GPS
			coordinate
			for. As you move your mouse, you will see the x and y coordinates on the map grid which span from 300 in the
			x-direction to 500 in the y-direction. These can be less depending on the aspect ratio of your map since
			they
			might be clipped in one direction to make the map fit the grid coordinate system. In the figure below, the
			cursor was placed at grid coordinate (277, 461) and then the mouse was clicked. (Unfortunately the image
			cannot
			pick up the &quot;+&quot; where the cursor was located.) This point was chosen since we assume that in a real
			situation we
			knew the GPS coordinate for the top, right corner of the &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; building in the image.
		
		As shown in the figure above, when that point was clicked, a message appeared below the map (inside the blue
			box
			used for highlighting) that says &quot;input GPS coordinate that corresponds to the point: x: 277, y: 461
			in this format -&gt; latitude,longitude&quot;. This confirms that the coordinate clicked was (277, 461). As the
			message
			states, you need to enter the GPS coordinate for this point on the map as a latitude, longitude pair
			separated
			by a comma. This is a common format for GPS coordinates but do not include parentheses when you enter the
			GPS
			value such as they are written above. You enter the GPS value in the box below this message.
			For this example, the GPS coordinate entered was 40.00461, -87.99723. The box where this
			was
			entered
			is inside the blue box used for highlighting as shown in the next figure.
		
		
		Once complete, you click the &quot;Submit&quot; button below the box for GPS (inside the blue box used for
			highlighting).
			This leads to the figure below. The text at the bottom of the web browser window, &quot;result: Need more points&quot;
			(highlighted with a blue box) indicates the result. It is stating that there are too few points to complete
			the
			calibration. OED needs a minimum of three points to calculate the error and possibly complete the
			calibration.
			Also note that the message will change the GPS value to &quot;undefined&quot; so it becomes &quot;input GPS coordinate that
			corresponds to the point: undefined
			in this format -&gt; latitude,longitude&quot; after you submit a point. This is to indicate that a new point has yet
			to
			be chosen.
		
		
		You now need to repeat the steps above to enter more calibration points. You can click anywhere on the map
			where
			you know the GPS coordinates. It is okay to click more than once to replace the point clicked with a new one
			as
			long
			as it is before you &quot;Submit&quot; the GPS value. See below for suggestions on points
				to
				use and how to get
				the GPS coordinates for
			points on the map. Once you have entered at least three calibration points, OED will give you an estimate of
			the
			overall calibration result (inside the blue box used for highlighting in the figure below).
		
		In this example, the result is &quot;result: x: 1.202% y: 0.25%&quot; (inside the blue box used for highlighting in the
			figure above). (Note the points used were deliberately shifted a little bit so a small error is shown.) If
			you
			are satisfied with the result, you click the &quot;Save changes to
			database&quot; (inside the blue box used for highlighting). See below for a discussion of the Calibration Result. If at any time you want to begin the calibration
			process
			again, you can click the &quot;Reset&quot; button. If the calibration is a little worse than you want, you can try to
			add more points to improve the error but this is not guaranteed to work. Once you save the
			calibration, you are taken to the Admin Map Viewing page that is shown
			below
			for
			a
			single
			map. If you want users to be able to see the map then make sure &quot;Display Enabled&quot; is shown. It is best to
			verify
			that items are showing up in the correct places before you reveal the map to users. Note you can recalibrate
			a map from this page.
		
		Once you set the GPS of meters, you can see their values on the map. (See the map
				graphing page for more information.) If you find that the circles are not showing up at the desired
			points, then see the section on circle placement issues below.

		You can repeat this process for as many maps as you want.

		Choosing calibration points and finding the GPS value
		OED uses the distance between calibration points to determine the quality of the points (called the &quot;result&quot;
			above). Spreading the points around the map increases the distance between the points. This is more likely
			to
			lead to correct placement of points around the entire map. If possible this should be done but not if it
			means
			you cannot get accurate GPS values for each calibration point entered.
		You can determine the GPS value of the calibration points in any way you wish. A way that is often accurate
			and
			easy is to use an online mapping site that contains an image that allows you to locate the same points that
			are
			contained in the image you will use inside OED. You can then click on that point on the map to get the GPS
			value. While OED does not endorse any particular online map, a popular one is Google Maps. With this you can
			left click on any point on a map to reveal information about that point. The first one is the GPS
			coordinates.
			If you right click on the GPS coordinate it will copy it to your clipboard. You can then paste this value
			into
			the OED box to input GPS coordinates during the calibration steps described above. Another technique is to
			physically go to the point on the map and use a cell phone application that shows your current GPS location.
			Whatever technique you use, it is important to get accurate values so your calibration is of high quality.
		

		Calibration result
		OED gives a result that provides an idea of how far off the calibration points are from each other. This may
			give
			you an idea of how accurately OED will place circles on the map. For example, three calibration points were
			entered on the map above where each one was changed by +/- 0.0001, which is changes in the 6th digit. This
			was
			done so the first calibration point had latitude and longitude increased by this amount, the second
			subtracted
			by this amount and the third had latitude increased and longitude decreased by this amount. As such, it was
			somewhat random if the value increased or decreased. For example, 40.00461, -87.99723 for the first point
			became
			40.00471, -87.99713. This lead to a result of &quot;result: x: 15.471%, y: 4.356%&quot;. This is the example used in
			the
			figure below. If you map circles that should
			be directly on &quot;Play Place&quot; and &quot;Theater&quot; you get the following. As seen, they have moved a little to the
			more
			accurate calibration above but are in the correct general place.
		
		If we change so that
			the each value is +/- 0.001 as done above then the result is much worse. The result is &quot;result: x: 76.423%,
			y:
			31.293%&quot;. The result of mapping is shown in the next figure where there are much more noticeable shifts.
		
		If we increased the change even further then the circles would shift even more and might eventually be off
			the
			map. When placement is poor, you need to recalibrate the map.
		Note that the error may not always indicate how poor placement will be. If every point was shifted a positive
			amount of +0.001 then OED will not find a calibration error due to the systematic shift but items placed on
			the
			map will be changed (assuming there is not a similar error in where meters are located). This example gives
			a
			result of &quot;result: x: 0%, y: 0%&quot; and the graphic shown next. Here the &quot;Play Place&quot; meter is no longer on the
			map.
		
		
		There are many possible reasons that the calibration might be off and we discuss several now. First, it is
			easy
			to type in the wrong value for a point. If this happens then correctly reentering the calibration values
			again
			will fix the issue. Second, a value for a calibration point is wrong. While a similar result to the first
			issue,
			it means rechecking each point to see which one(s) might be off. Third, the accuracy of the points is too
			low.
			This requires using another technique to get the values. This can happen, for example, if the map you used
			to
			get the GPS coordinates has features placed at a different location than on the map you uploaded to OED. It
			could also happen because manually read GPS values (such as going to a place and using the value shown of
			your
			cell phone) are off. This is due to the inherent accuracy of the device in getting the GPS coordinate or
			standing in the correct location. While many issues can happen, the OED project found that getting the
			correct
			value is usually possible and led to good placement on the map. Getting a good calibration is the easiest
			way to
			place items on the map. See the next section for ideas on fixing poor placement of the circles on the map.
		

		Circle placement issues
		If you have done the best you can to calibrate the map but you still have circle(s) in the wrong place then
			you
			can manually fix them in the meter GPS value. OED only uses the GPS value for placing items on maps so
			fudging
			this value does not have other consequences or lead to incorrect results. This is usually easiest if the
			circles
			are reasonably close to the desired location on the map. Going back to the first calibration error example
			where
			it was +/-0.0001, we can see that &quot;Play Place&quot; is a little off but &quot;Theater&quot; seems fine. We notice it is
			somewhat to the down and right from the middle of that building. Looking at GPS values for this map
			indicates
			that as you go up the longitude gets larger and as you go left the longitude gets smaller (more negative).
			The
			correct meter GPS for &quot;Play Place&quot; is (40.00419, -87.99916). Noting that the GPS for &quot;Theater&quot; is (40.0027,
			-87.9975) we know that the changes needed are small so we start with (40.00469, -87.99966) (changed by
			0.0005).
			By using the
			Admin Map Viewing page, the GPS value was changed for &quot;Place Place&quot; to
			this
			value. This moved &quot;Play Place&quot;
			much too far up and left so we now tried (40.00420, -87.99917) but the shift was too small. Next we tried
			(40.00429, -87.99926) and this worked fairly well as shown in the next figure. We could have done some more
			adjustment to slightly shift the &quot;Play Place&quot; circle if we wanted.
		
		
		One thing to note is that this process is only done once when a new map is loaded. After that, any user will
			see
			the correct result. Also, once you move one point on the map it becomes clearer the amount needed for other
			circles so it usually takes less time.
		There are circumstance that can make it impossible to modify the meter GPS to get it in the correct place on
			the
			map. One is if the needed correction means the GPS value goes outside allowed values then OED will not allow
			the
			entry of this GPS value. This should only happen if the calibration is off significantly and should be
			rectified
			if the map calibration is redone with greater accuracy. A second is if two maps overlap in area so changing
			the
			GPS of a meter causes one map to be fine but another now has it in the wrong place. Proper calibration is
			the
			solution in this case.

			OED internally supports maps with any rotation from true north. There is not currently an admin
				interface to
				allow entering this value. The plan is to add this soon. If you need rotated maps then contact us for
				how
				you can do it at the current time.
			You cannot place a group on a map. The planned changes will give admins the ability to give a group GPS
				coordinates
				and
				users to place on a map.
			 OED internally supports the setting of the maximum circle size. This is specified as a fraction of the
				total map size and currently defaults to 0.15 or 15% of the map size. This generally works well.
				However, it
				can be suboptimal if items being placed on the map are close together or you want to have larger circles
				for
				viewing. OED plans to add an admin interface in the near future to allow admins to set this value for
				each
				map. Until then, please contact us if you need to modify the circle sizes on your maps.
		

		Previous versions
		The first version of maps (OED v0.6.0) calculated the error from calibration in a poor way. The new method

These features are only available to select people who oversee the OED site (called admins) so this information is not usually of interest to a general user.





		Overview
		See the map graphic page for general information on OED and maps. Note that
			unlike
			many systems, using maps in OED does not require any additional software nor the use of GIS. Instead, you
			load a
			graphical image you want to use as a map. This can be anything from a real map, a stylized graphic with
			buildings and features of interest to an arbitrary graphic. Once loaded, you calibrate this map by informing
			OED
			about a few GPS coordinates for items on the map. OED will automatically allow users to place meters on a
			graph
			as long as you have input the GPS data for that meter. OED allows sites
			to
			have
			as many maps as they wish and maps can overlap. For example, you could have maps with two different sites
			and a
			map that zooms in to show details of one of the sites.
		This greatly simplified
			system is based on a simple assumption that the map is flat. In actuality, the world is a sphere so that it
			is
			curved. However, over modest distances, it is effectively flat. This is why local maps don&#39;t appear warped
			but
			ones of the entire global make some areas look much larger than they really are. Since most maps involving a
			site are over very modest distances this works very well. If you want a large geographical area map then see
			circle placement below on making this work. Note that you can have
			different maps that are very
			far apart without any issue. It is only a single map covering a large area that causes issues.
		For this system to work, OED needs to know the rotation of each map from true north. This allows OED to align
			the
			real world longitude and latitude (used in GPS) with the map graphic. OED internally stores this rotation as
			the
			angle from true north on the map graphic to straight up on the map graphic going in the counterclockwise
			direction. OED can then use this angle to properly calibrate the map and place items on the map (see below).
			While this is fully functional within OED, there is not yet an admin interface to set the rotation angle. We
			plan to soon add the needed interface so the admin can set the rotation angle for each map. When
			that is done, this help page will be enhanced to explain how to get the rotation angle and place it in OED
			for a
			given map. Until that time you should contact OED for help in dealing with rotated maps.

		Usage
		If you click on the &quot;Maps&quot; button in the top, right of the main OED screen you will go to the maps page shown
			below. This shows the page when no maps are on the site. Click the blue &quot;Create a Map&quot; button to begin the
			process of uploading a map.
		
		You should now be on the page shown below. Click on the &quot;Browse ...&quot; button (highlighted with a blue box) to
			open
			a standard web browser pop up to select a file. Choose the graphical image of your map. Note the image can
			be of
			types JPEG or PNG (the file extension does not matter but the contents must be one of these two image
			types).
			OED will allow you to choose other types of files and tell you the upload is complete but you
			will find the file image does not appear on the next step. There are many programs/apps that will allow you
			to
			convert to one of these two types of graphical images. Once you have uploaded the map image, use the box
			immediately below (labeled &quot;Define a name for the map:&quot;) to name your map. Note this is the name that a user
			will see (it can be edited later). In this example, &quot;Happy Place&quot; was used. When
			you are ready, click the &quot;Save and continue&quot; button to complete this step.
		
		You should then see the confirmation popup shown below. The exact look differs depending on your web browser.
			It
			may or may not show the URL and it will definitely differ from localhost:3000 (special URL for development).
			Click &quot;OK&quot; to continue the process.
		
		You should now be on the map calibration page shown below. This page allows you to enter the GPS coordinates
			for
			places on the map so OED can map locations on the map to locations on the globe (world map). You should
			place
			your curser that will appear as a &quot;+&quot; symbol at the point on the map that you wish to enter the GPS
			coordinate
			for. As you move your mouse, you will see the x and y coordinates on the map grid which span from 300 in the
			x-direction to 500 in the y-direction. These can be less depending on the aspect ratio of your map since
			they
			might be clipped in one direction to make the map fit the grid coordinate system. In the figure below, the
			cursor was placed at grid coordinate (277, 461) and then the mouse was clicked. (Unfortunately the image
			cannot
			pick up the &quot;+&quot; where the cursor was located.) This point was chosen since we assume that in a real
			situation we
			knew the GPS coordinate for the top, right corner of the &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; building in the image.
		
		As shown in the figure above, when that point was clicked, a message appeared below the map (inside the blue
			box
			used for highlighting) that says &quot;input GPS coordinate that corresponds to the point: x: 277, y: 461
			in this format -&gt; latitude,longitude&quot;. This confirms that the coordinate clicked was (277, 461). As the
			message
			states, you need to enter the GPS coordinate for this point on the map as a latitude, longitude pair
			separated
			by a comma. This is a common format for GPS coordinates but do not include parentheses when you enter the
			GPS
			value such as they are written above. You enter the GPS value in the box below this message.
			For this example, the GPS coordinate entered was 40.00461, -87.99723. The box where this
			was
			entered
			is inside the blue box used for highlighting as shown in the next figure.
		
		
		Once complete, you click the &quot;Submit&quot; button below the box for GPS (inside the blue box used for
			highlighting).
			This leads to the figure below. The text at the bottom of the web browser window, &quot;result: Need more points&quot;
			(highlighted with a blue box) indicates the result. It is stating that there are too few points to complete
			the
			calibration. OED needs a minimum of three points to calculate the error and possibly complete the
			calibration.
			Also note that the message will change the GPS value to &quot;undefined&quot; so it becomes &quot;input GPS coordinate that
			corresponds to the point: undefined
			in this format -&gt; latitude,longitude&quot; after you submit a point. This is to indicate that a new point has yet
			to
			be chosen.
		
		
		You now need to repeat the steps above to enter more calibration points. You can click anywhere on the map
			where
			you know the GPS coordinates. It is okay to click more than once to replace the point clicked with a new one
			as
			long
			as it is before you &quot;Submit&quot; the GPS value. See below for suggestions on points
				to
				use and how to get
				the GPS coordinates for
			points on the map. Once you have entered at least three calibration points, OED will give you an estimate of
			the
			overall calibration result (inside the blue box used for highlighting in the figure below).
		
		In this example, the result is &quot;result: x: 1.202% y: 0.25%&quot; (inside the blue box used for highlighting in the
			figure above). (Note the points used were deliberately shifted a little bit so a small error is shown.) If
			you
			are satisfied with the result, you click the &quot;Save changes to
			database&quot; (inside the blue box used for highlighting). See below for a discussion of the Calibration Result. If at any time you want to begin the calibration
			process
			again, you can click the &quot;Reset&quot; button. If the calibration is a little worse than you want, you can try to
			add more points to improve the error but this is not guaranteed to work. Once you save the
			calibration, you are taken to the Admin Map Viewing page that is shown
			below
			for
			a
			single
			map. If you want users to be able to see the map then make sure &quot;Display Enabled&quot; is shown. It is best to
			verify
			that items are showing up in the correct places before you reveal the map to users. Note you can recalibrate
			a map from this page.
		
		Once you set the GPS of meters, you can see their values on the map. (See the map
				graphing page for more information.) If you find that the circles are not showing up at the desired
			points, then see the section on circle placement issues below.

		You can repeat this process for as many maps as you want.

		Choosing calibration points and finding the GPS value
		OED uses the distance between calibration points to determine the quality of the points (called the &quot;result&quot;
			above). Spreading the points around the map increases the distance between the points. This is more likely
			to
			lead to correct placement of points around the entire map. If possible this should be done but not if it
			means
			you cannot get accurate GPS values for each calibration point entered.
		You can determine the GPS value of the calibration points in any way you wish. A way that is often accurate
			and
			easy is to use an online mapping site that contains an image that allows you to locate the same points that
			are
			contained in the image you will use inside OED. You can then click on that point on the map to get the GPS
			value. While OED does not endorse any particular online map, a popular one is Google Maps. With this you can
			left click on any point on a map to reveal information about that point. The first one is the GPS
			coordinates.
			If you right click on the GPS coordinate it will copy it to your clipboard. You can then paste this value
			into
			the OED box to input GPS coordinates during the calibration steps described above. Another technique is to
			physically go to the point on the map and use a cell phone application that shows your current GPS location.
			Whatever technique you use, it is important to get accurate values so your calibration is of high quality.
		

		Calibration result
		OED gives a result that provides an idea of how far off the calibration points are from each other. This may
			give
			you an idea of how accurately OED will place circles on the map. For example, three calibration points were
			entered on the map above where each one was changed by +/- 0.0001, which is changes in the 6th digit. This
			was
			done so the first calibration point had latitude and longitude increased by this amount, the second
			subtracted
			by this amount and the third had latitude increased and longitude decreased by this amount. As such, it was
			somewhat random if the value increased or decreased. For example, 40.00461, -87.99723 for the first point
			became
			40.00471, -87.99713. This lead to a result of &quot;result: x: 15.471%, y: 4.356%&quot;. This is the example used in
			the
			figure below. If you map circles that should
			be directly on &quot;Play Place&quot; and &quot;Theater&quot; you get the following. As seen, they have moved a little to the
			more
			accurate calibration above but are in the correct general place.
		
		If we change so that
			the each value is +/- 0.001 as done above then the result is much worse. The result is &quot;result: x: 76.423%,
			y:
			31.293%&quot;. The result of mapping is shown in the next figure where there are much more noticeable shifts.
		
		If we increased the change even further then the circles would shift even more and might eventually be off
			the
			map. When placement is poor, you need to recalibrate the map.
		Note that the error may not always indicate how poor placement will be. If every point was shifted a positive
			amount of +0.001 then OED will not find a calibration error due to the systematic shift but items placed on
			the
			map will be changed (assuming there is not a similar error in where meters are located). This example gives
			a
			result of &quot;result: x: 0%, y: 0%&quot; and the graphic shown next. Here the &quot;Play Place&quot; meter is no longer on the
			map.
		
		
		There are many possible reasons that the calibration might be off and we discuss several now. First, it is
			easy
			to type in the wrong value for a point. If this happens then correctly reentering the calibration values
			again
			will fix the issue. Second, a value for a calibration point is wrong. While a similar result to the first
			issue,
			it means rechecking each point to see which one(s) might be off. Third, the accuracy of the points is too
			low.
			This requires using another technique to get the values. This can happen, for example, if the map you used
			to
			get the GPS coordinates has features placed at a different location than on the map you uploaded to OED. It
			could also happen because manually read GPS values (such as going to a place and using the value shown of
			your
			cell phone) are off. This is due to the inherent accuracy of the device in getting the GPS coordinate or
			standing in the correct location. While many issues can happen, the OED project found that getting the
			correct
			value is usually possible and led to good placement on the map. Getting a good calibration is the easiest
			way to
			place items on the map. See the next section for ideas on fixing poor placement of the circles on the map.
		

		Circle placement issues
		If you have done the best you can to calibrate the map but you still have circle(s) in the wrong place then
			you
			can manually fix them in the meter GPS value. OED only uses the GPS value for placing items on maps so
			fudging
			this value does not have other consequences or lead to incorrect results. This is usually easiest if the
			circles
			are reasonably close to the desired location on the map. Going back to the first calibration error example
			where
			it was +/-0.0001, we can see that &quot;Play Place&quot; is a little off but &quot;Theater&quot; seems fine. We notice it is
			somewhat to the down and right from the middle of that building. Looking at GPS values for this map
			indicates
			that as you go up the longitude gets larger and as you go left the longitude gets smaller (more negative).
			The
			correct meter GPS for &quot;Play Place&quot; is (40.00419, -87.99916). Noting that the GPS for &quot;Theater&quot; is (40.0027,
			-87.9975) we know that the changes needed are small so we start with (40.00469, -87.99966) (changed by
			0.0005).
			By using the
			Admin Map Viewing page, the GPS value was changed for &quot;Place Place&quot; to
			this
			value. This moved &quot;Play Place&quot;
			much too far up and left so we now tried (40.00420, -87.99917) but the shift was too small. Next we tried
			(40.00429, -87.99926) and this worked fairly well as shown in the next figure. We could have done some more
			adjustment to slightly shift the &quot;Play Place&quot; circle if we wanted.
		
		
		One thing to note is that this process is only done once when a new map is loaded. After that, any user will
			see
			the correct result. Also, once you move one point on the map it becomes clearer the amount needed for other
			circles so it usually takes less time.
		There are circumstance that can make it impossible to modify the meter GPS to get it in the correct place on
			the
			map. One is if the needed correction means the GPS value goes outside allowed values then OED will not allow
			the
			entry of this GPS value. This should only happen if the calibration is off significantly and should be
			rectified
			if the map calibration is redone with greater accuracy. A second is if two maps overlap in area so changing
			the
			GPS of a meter causes one map to be fine but another now has it in the wrong place. Proper calibration is
			the
			solution in this case.

		Details
		Current limitations
		
			OED internally supports maps with any rotation from true north. There is not currently an admin
				interface to
				allow entering this value. The plan is to add this soon. If you need rotated maps then contact us for
				how
				you can do it at the current time.
			You cannot place a group on a map. The planned changes will give admins the ability to give a group GPS
				coordinates
				and
				users to place on a map.
			 OED internally supports the setting of the maximum circle size. This is specified as a fraction of the
				total map size and currently defaults to 0.15 or 15% of the map size. This generally works well.
				However, it
				can be suboptimal if items being placed on the map are close together or you want to have larger circles
				for
				viewing. OED plans to add an admin interface in the near future to allow admins to set this value for
				each
				map. Until then, please contact us if you need to modify the circle sizes on your maps.
		

		Previous versions
		The first version of maps (OED v0.6.0) calculated the error from calibration in a poor way. The new method
			gives
			more
			information but yields significantly different values.">

<div class="alert-box info "><p>These features are only available to select people who oversee the OED site (called admins) so this information is not usually of interest to a general user.</p>
</div>




		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
		<p>See the <a href="../mapGraphic/">map graphic page</a> for general information on OED and maps. Note that
			unlike
			many systems, using maps in OED does not require any additional software nor the use of GIS. Instead, you
			load a
			graphical image you want to use as a map. This can be anything from a real map, a stylized graphic with
			buildings and features of interest to an arbitrary graphic. Once loaded, you calibrate this map by informing
			OED
			about a few GPS coordinates for items on the map. OED will automatically allow users to place meters on a
			graph
			as long as you have <a href="../adminMeterViewing/">input the GPS data for that meter</a>. OED allows sites
			to
			have
			as many maps as they wish and maps can overlap. For example, you could have maps with two different sites
			and a
			map that zooms in to show details of one of the sites.</p>
		<p>This greatly simplified
			system is based on a simple assumption that the map is flat. In actuality, the world is a sphere so that it
			is
			curved. However, over modest distances, it is effectively flat. This is why local maps don't appear warped
			but
			ones of the entire global make some areas look much larger than they really are. Since most maps involving a
			site are over very modest distances this works very well. If you want a large geographical area map then see
			<a href="#circlePlacementIssues">circle placement below</a> on making this work. Note that you can have
			different maps that are very
			far apart without any issue. It is only a single map covering a large area that causes issues.</p>
		<p>For this system to work, OED needs to know the rotation of each map from true north. This allows OED to align
			the
			real world longitude and latitude (used in GPS) with the map graphic. OED internally stores this rotation as
			the
			angle from true north on the map graphic to straight up on the map graphic going in the counterclockwise
			direction. OED can then use this angle to properly calibrate the map and place items on the map (see below).
			While this is fully functional within OED, there is not yet an admin interface to set the rotation angle. We
			plan to soon add the needed interface so the admin can set the rotation angle for each map. When
			that is done, this help page will be enhanced to explain how to get the rotation angle and place it in OED
			for a
			given map. Until that time you should contact OED for help in dealing with rotated maps.</p>

		<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
		<p>If you click on the "Maps" button in the top, right of the main OED screen you will go to the maps page shown
			below. This shows the page when no maps are on the site. Click the blue "Create a Map" button to begin the
			process of uploading a map.</p>
		<img alt="admin map page without maps" src="../images/OEDAdminMapViewingEmpty.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>You should now be on the page shown below. Click on the "Browse ..." button (highlighted with a blue box) to
			open
			a standard web browser pop up to select a file. Choose the graphical image of your map. Note the image can
			be of
			types JPEG or PNG (the file extension does not matter but the contents must be one of these two image
			types).
			OED will allow you to choose other types of files and tell you the upload is complete but you
			will find the file image does not appear on the next step. There are many programs/apps that will allow you
			to
			convert to one of these two types of graphical images. Once you have uploaded the map image, use the box
			immediately below (labeled "Define a name for the map:") to name your map. Note this is the name that a user
			will see (it can be edited later). In this example, "Happy Place" was used. When
			you are ready, click the "Save and continue" button to complete this step.</p>
		<img alt="admin map loading page" src="../images/OEDAdminLoadMap.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>You should then see the confirmation popup shown below. The exact look differs depending on your web browser.
			It
			may or may not show the URL and it will definitely differ from localhost:3000 (special URL for development).
			Click "OK" to continue the process.</p>
		<img alt="admin map loading completion popup" src="../images/OEDAdminMapUploadComplete.png"
			style="width: 20vw; min-width: 250px;">
		<p>You should now be on the map calibration page shown below. This page allows you to enter the GPS coordinates
			for
			places on the map so OED can map locations on the map to locations on the globe (world map). You should
			place
			your curser that will appear as a "+" symbol at the point on the map that you wish to enter the GPS
			coordinate
			for. As you move your mouse, you will see the x and y coordinates on the map grid which span from 300 in the
			x-direction to 500 in the y-direction. These can be less depending on the aspect ratio of your map since
			they
			might be clipped in one direction to make the map fit the grid coordinate system. In the figure below, the
			cursor was placed at grid coordinate (277, 461) and then the mouse was clicked. (Unfortunately the image
			cannot
			pick up the "+" where the cursor was located.) This point was chosen since we assume that in a real
			situation we
			knew the GPS coordinate for the top, right corner of the "Swimming Pool" building in the image.</p>
		<img alt="admin map calibration point entry" src="../images/OEDAdminMapCalibrationStepOne.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>As shown in the figure above, when that point was clicked, a message appeared below the map (inside the blue
			box
			used for highlighting) that says "input GPS coordinate that corresponds to the point: x: 277, y: 461
			in this format -> latitude,longitude". This confirms that the coordinate clicked was (277, 461). As the
			message
			states, you need to enter the GPS coordinate for this point on the map as a latitude, longitude pair
			separated
			by a comma. This is a common format for GPS coordinates but do not include parentheses when you enter the
			GPS
			value such as they are written above. You enter the GPS value in the box below this message.
			For this example, the GPS coordinate entered was 40.00461, -87.99723. The box where this
			was
			entered
			is inside the blue box used for highlighting as shown in the next figure.
		</p>
		<img alt="admin map GPS entry for a calibration point" src="../images/OEDAdminMapCalibrationStepTwo.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>Once complete, you click the "Submit" button below the box for GPS (inside the blue box used for
			highlighting).
			This leads to the figure below. The text at the bottom of the web browser window, "result: Need more points"
			(highlighted with a blue box) indicates the result. It is stating that there are too few points to complete
			the
			calibration. OED needs a minimum of three points to calculate the error and possibly complete the
			calibration.
			Also note that the message will change the GPS value to "undefined" so it becomes "input GPS coordinate that
			corresponds to the point: undefined
			in this format -> latitude,longitude" after you submit a point. This is to indicate that a new point has yet
			to
			be chosen.
		</p>
		<img alt="admin map showing need more calibration points" src="../images/OEDAdminMapCalibrationStepThree.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>You now need to repeat the steps above to enter more calibration points. You can click anywhere on the map
			where
			you know the GPS coordinates. It is okay to click more than once to replace the point clicked with a new one
			as
			long
			as it is before you "Submit" the GPS value. See below for <a href="#calibrationPoints">suggestions on points
				to
				use and how to get
				the GPS coordinates</a> for
			points on the map. Once you have entered at least three calibration points, OED will give you an estimate of
			the
			overall calibration result (inside the blue box used for highlighting in the figure below).</p>
		<img alt="admin map showing result of current calibration points"
			src="../images/OEDAdminMapCalibrationStepFour.png" style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>In this example, the result is "result: x: 1.202% y: 0.25%" (inside the blue box used for highlighting in the
			figure above). (Note the points used were deliberately shifted a little bit so a small error is shown.) If
			you
			are satisfied with the result, you click the "Save changes to
			database" (inside the blue box used for highlighting). See below for a discussion of the <a
				href="#calibrationResult">Calibration Result</a>. If at any time you want to begin the calibration
			process
			again, you can click the "Reset" button. If the calibration is a little worse than you want, you can try to
			add more points to improve the error but this is not guaranteed to work. Once you save the
			calibration, you are taken to the <a href="../adminMapViewing/">Admin Map Viewing</a> page that is shown
			below
			for
			a
			single
			map. If you want users to be able to see the map then make sure "Display Enabled" is shown. It is best to
			verify
			that items are showing up in the correct places before you reveal the map to users. Note you can recalibrate
			a map from this page.</p>
		<img alt="admin map viewing page after calibration" src="../images/OEDAdminMapViewingAfterCalibration.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>Once you set the GPS of meters, you can see their values on the map. (See the <a href="../mapGraphic/">map
				graphing</a> page for more information.) If you find that the circles are not showing up at the desired
			points, then see the section on <a href="#circlePlacementIssues">circle placement issues</a> below.</p>

		<p>You can repeat this process for as many maps as you want.</p>

		<h3 id="calibrationPoints">Choosing calibration points and finding the GPS value</h3>
		<p>OED uses the distance between calibration points to determine the quality of the points (called the "result"
			above). Spreading the points around the map increases the distance between the points. This is more likely
			to
			lead to correct placement of points around the entire map. If possible this should be done but not if it
			means
			you cannot get accurate GPS values for each calibration point entered.</p>
		<p>You can determine the GPS value of the calibration points in any way you wish. A way that is often accurate
			and
			easy is to use an online mapping site that contains an image that allows you to locate the same points that
			are
			contained in the image you will use inside OED. You can then click on that point on the map to get the GPS
			value. While OED does not endorse any particular online map, a popular one is Google Maps. With this you can
			left click on any point on a map to reveal information about that point. The first one is the GPS
			coordinates.
			If you right click on the GPS coordinate it will copy it to your clipboard. You can then paste this value
			into
			the OED box to input GPS coordinates during the calibration steps described above. Another technique is to
			physically go to the point on the map and use a cell phone application that shows your current GPS location.
			Whatever technique you use, it is important to get accurate values so your calibration is of high quality.
		</p>

		<h3 id="calibrationResult">Calibration result</h3>
		<p>OED gives a result that provides an idea of how far off the calibration points are from each other. This may
			give
			you an idea of how accurately OED will place circles on the map. For example, three calibration points were
			entered on the map above where each one was changed by +/- 0.0001, which is changes in the 6th digit. This
			was
			done so the first calibration point had latitude and longitude increased by this amount, the second
			subtracted
			by this amount and the third had latitude increased and longitude decreased by this amount. As such, it was
			somewhat random if the value increased or decreased. For example, 40.00461, -87.99723 for the first point
			became
			40.00471, -87.99713. This lead to a result of "result: x: 15.471%, y: 4.356%". This is the example used in
			the
			figure below. If you map circles that should
			be directly on "Play Place" and "Theater" you get the following. As seen, they have moved a little to the
			more
			accurate calibration above but are in the correct general place.</p>
		<img alt="admin map small calibration error result" src="../images/OEDAdminMapResultOne.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>If we change so that
			the each value is +/- 0.001 as done above then the result is much worse. The result is "result: x: 76.423%,
			y:
			31.293%". The result of mapping is shown in the next figure where there are much more noticeable shifts.</p>
		<img alt="admin map larger calibration error result" src="../images/OEDAdminMapResultTwo.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>If we increased the change even further then the circles would shift even more and might eventually be off
			the
			map. When placement is poor, you need to recalibrate the map.</p>
		<p>Note that the error may not always indicate how poor placement will be. If every point was shifted a positive
			amount of +0.001 then OED will not find a calibration error due to the systematic shift but items placed on
			the
			map will be changed (assuming there is not a similar error in where meters are located). This example gives
			a
			result of "result: x: 0%, y: 0%" and the graphic shown next. Here the "Play Place" meter is no longer on the
			map.
		</p>
		<img alt="admin map larger shift in one direction but no error" src="../images/OEDAdminMapResultThree.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>There are many possible reasons that the calibration might be off and we discuss several now. First, it is
			easy
			to type in the wrong value for a point. If this happens then correctly reentering the calibration values
			again
			will fix the issue. Second, a value for a calibration point is wrong. While a similar result to the first
			issue,
			it means rechecking each point to see which one(s) might be off. Third, the accuracy of the points is too
			low.
			This requires using another technique to get the values. This can happen, for example, if the map you used
			to
			get the GPS coordinates has features placed at a different location than on the map you uploaded to OED. It
			could also happen because manually read GPS values (such as going to a place and using the value shown of
			your
			cell phone) are off. This is due to the inherent accuracy of the device in getting the GPS coordinate or
			standing in the correct location. While many issues can happen, the OED project found that getting the
			correct
			value is usually possible and led to good placement on the map. Getting a good calibration is the easiest
			way to
			place items on the map. See the next section for ideas on fixing poor placement of the circles on the map.
		</p>

		<h3 id="circlePlacementIssues">Circle placement issues</h3>
		<p>If you have done the best you can to calibrate the map but you still have circle(s) in the wrong place then
			you
			can manually fix them in the meter GPS value. OED only uses the GPS value for placing items on maps so
			fudging
			this value does not have other consequences or lead to incorrect results. This is usually easiest if the
			circles
			are reasonably close to the desired location on the map. Going back to the first calibration error example
			where
			it was +/-0.0001, we can see that "Play Place" is a little off but "Theater" seems fine. We notice it is
			somewhat to the down and right from the middle of that building. Looking at GPS values for this map
			indicates
			that as you go up the longitude gets larger and as you go left the longitude gets smaller (more negative).
			The
			correct meter GPS for "Play Place" is (40.00419, -87.99916). Noting that the GPS for "Theater" is (40.0027,
			-87.9975) we know that the changes needed are small so we start with (40.00469, -87.99966) (changed by
			0.0005).
			By using the
			<a href="../adminMapViewing/">Admin Map Viewing</a> page, the GPS value was changed for "Place Place" to
			this
			value. This moved "Play Place"
			much too far up and left so we now tried (40.00420, -87.99917) but the shift was too small. Next we tried
			(40.00429, -87.99926) and this worked fairly well as shown in the next figure. We could have done some more
			adjustment to slightly shift the "Play Place" circle if we wanted.
		</p>
		<img alt="admin map larger calibration error fixed result" src="../images/OEDAdminMapCalibrationFixed.png"
			style="width: 75vw; min-width: 700px;">
		<p>One thing to note is that this process is only done once when a new map is loaded. After that, any user will
			see
			the correct result. Also, once you move one point on the map it becomes clearer the amount needed for other
			circles so it usually takes less time.</p>
		<p>There are circumstance that can make it impossible to modify the meter GPS to get it in the correct place on
			the
			map. One is if the needed correction means the GPS value goes outside allowed values then OED will not allow
			the
			entry of this GPS value. This should only happen if the calibration is off significantly and should be
			rectified
			if the map calibration is redone with greater accuracy. A second is if two maps overlap in area so changing
			the
			GPS of a meter causes one map to be fine but another now has it in the wrong place. Proper calibration is
			the
			solution in this case.</p>

		<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
		<h3>Current limitations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>OED internally supports maps with any rotation from true north. There is not currently an admin
				interface to
				allow entering this value. The plan is to add this soon. If you need rotated maps then contact us for
				how
				you can do it at the current time.</li>
			<li>You cannot place a group on a map. The planned changes will give admins the ability to give a group GPS
				coordinates
				and
				users to place on a map.</li>
			<li> OED internally supports the setting of the maximum circle size. This is specified as a fraction of the
				total map size and currently defaults to 0.15 or 15% of the map size. This generally works well.
				However, it
				can be suboptimal if items being placed on the map are close together or you want to have larger circles
				for
				viewing. OED plans to add an admin interface in the near future to allow admins to set this value for
				each
				map. Until then, please contact us if you need to modify the circle sizes on your maps.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Previous versions</h3>
		<p>The first version of maps (OED v0.6.0) calculated the error from calibration in a poor way. The new method
			gives
			more
			information but yields significantly different values.</p>
